![SharePoint Patterns and Practices](https://devofficecdn.azureedge.net/media/Default/PnP/sppnp.png)

PnPjs is a fluent JavaScript API for consuming SharePoint and Office 365 REST APIs in a type-safe way. You can use it with SharePoint Framework, Nodejs, or JavaScript projects. This an open source initiative complements existing SDKs provided by Microsoft offering developers another way to consume information from SharePoint and Office 365.
