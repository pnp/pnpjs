To get started you need to install the libraries you need via npm. Many of the packages have a peer dependency to other packages with the @pnp namespace meaning you may need to install more than one package. All packages are released together eliminating version confusion - all packages will depend on packages with the same version number. If you need to support older browsers please revert to version 2 of the library and see related documentation on polyfills for required functionality. Install \u00b6 First you will need to install those libraries you want to use in your application. Here we will install the most frequently used packages. @pnp/sp to access the SharePoint REST API and @pnp/graph to access some of the Microsoft Graph API. This step applies to any environment or project. npm install @pnp/sp @pnp/graph --save Next we can import and use the functionality within our application. Below is a very simple example, please see the individual package documentation for more details and examples. import { getRandomString } from \"@pnp/core\"; (function() { // get and log a random string console.log(getRandomString(20)); })() Getting Started with SharePoint Framework \u00b6 The @pnp/sp and @pnp/graph libraries are designed to work seamlessly within SharePoint Framework projects with a small amount of upfront configuration. If you are running in 2016 or 2019 on-premises you will need to use version 2 of the library. If you are targeting SharePoint online you will need to take the additional steps outlined below based on the version of the SharePoint Framework you are targeting. //TODO:: Add additonal SPFx configuration steps based on SPFx Version Because SharePoint Framework provides a local context to each component we need to set that context within the library. This allows us to determine request urls as well as use the SPFx HttpGraphClient within @pnp/graph. To establish context within the library you will need to use the SharePoint or Graph Factory Interface depending on which set of APIs you want to utilize. For SharePoint you will use the spfi interface and for the Microsoft Graph you will use the graphfi interface whic are both in the main export of the corresponding package. Examples of both methods are shown below. Depending on how you architect your solution establishing context is done where you want to make calls to the API. The examples demonstrate doing so in the onInit method as a local variable but this could also be done to a private variable or passed into a service. Using @pnp/sp spfi factory interface \u00b6 import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; // ... protected async onInit(): Promise<void> { await super.onInit(); const sp = spfi().using(SPFx(this.context)); } // ... Using @pnp/graph graphfi factory interface \u00b6 import { graphfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/graph\"; // ... protected async onInit(): Promise<void> { await super.onInit(); const graph = graphfi().using(SPFx(this.context)); } // ... Establish context within an SPFx service \u00b6 Because you do not have full access to the context object within a service you need to setup things a little differently. If you do not need AAD tokens you can leave that part out and specify just the pageContext (Option 2). import { ServiceKey, ServiceScope } from \"@microsoft/sp-core-library\"; import { PageContext } from \"@microsoft/sp-page-context\"; import { AadTokenProviderFactory } from \"@microsoft/sp-http\"; import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists/web\"; export interface ISampleService { getLists(): Promise<any[]>; } export class SampleService { public static readonly serviceKey: ServiceKey<ISampleService> = ServiceKey.create<ISampleService>('SPFx:SampleService', SampleService); private _sp: SPFI; constructor(serviceScope: ServiceScope) { serviceScope.whenFinished(() => { const pageContext = serviceScope.consume(PageContext.serviceKey); const tokenProviderFactory = serviceScope.consume(AadTokenProviderFactory.serviceKey); //Option 1 - with AADTokenProvider this._sp = spfi().using(SPFx({ spfxContext: { aadTokenProviderFactory: tokenProviderFactory, pageContext: pageContext, } })); //Option 2 - without AADTokenProvider this._sp = spfi().using(SPFx(pageContext)); }); } public getLists(): Promise<any[]> { return this._sp.web.lists(); } } Getting started with NodeJS \u00b6 Using @pnp/sp spfi factory interface \u00b6 Version 3 of this library only supports ESModules. If for some reason you still require commonjs modules please check out Version 2. The first step is to install the packages that will be needed. You can read more about what each package does starting on the packages page. npm i @pnp/sp @pnp/nodejs Once these are installed you need to import them into your project, to communicate with SharePoint from node we'll need the following imports: import { SPDefault } from \"@pnp/nodejs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import { readFileSync } from 'fs'; import { Configuration } from \"@azure/msal-node\"; function() { // configure your node options (only once in your application) const buffer = readFileSync(\"c:/temp/key.pem\"); const config: Configuration = { auth: { authority: \"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant id or common}/\", clientId: \"{application (client) id}\", clientCertificate: { thumbprint: \"{certificate thumbprint, displayed in AAD}\", privateKey: buffer.toString(), }, }, }; const sp = spfi().using(SPDefault({ baseUrl: 'https://{my tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/dev/', msal: { config: config, scopes: [ 'https://{my tenant}.sharepoint.com/.default' ] } })); // make a call to SharePoint and log it in the console const w = await sp.web.select(\"Title\", \"Description\")(); console.log(JSON.stringify(w, null, 4)); }(); Using @pnp/graph graphfi factory interface \u00b6 Similar to the above you can also make calls to the Microsoft Graph API from node using the libraries. Again we start with installing the required resources. You can see ./debug/launch/graph.ts for a live example. npm i @pnp/graph @pnp/nodejs Now we need to import what we'll need to call graph import { graphfi } from \"@pnp/graph\"; import { GraphDefault } from \"@pnp/nodejs\"; import \"@pnp/graph/users\"; function() { const graph = graphfi().using(GraphDefault({ baseUrl: 'https://graph.microsoft.com', msal: { config: config, scopes: [ 'https://graph.microsoft.com/.default' ] } })); // make a call to Graph and get all the groups const userInfo = await graph.users.top(1)(); console.log(JSON.stringify(userInfo, null, 4)); }(); Single Page Application Context \u00b6 In some cases you may be working in a client-side application that doesn't have context to the SharePoint site. In that case you will need to utilize the MSAL Client, you can get the details on creating that connection in this article . Selective Imports \u00b6 This library has a lot of functionality and you may not need all of it. For that reason, we support selective imports which allow you to only import the parts of the sp or graph library you need, which reduces your overall solution bundle size - and enables treeshaking . You can read more about selective imports . Error Handling \u00b6 This article describes the most common types of errors generated by the library. It provides context on the error object, and ways to handle the errors. As always you should tailor your error handling to what your application needs. These are ideas that can be applied to many different patterns. Extending the Library \u00b6 Because of the way the fluent library is designed by definition it's extendible. That means that if you want to build your own custom functions that extend the features of the library this can be done fairly simply. To get more information about creating your own custom extensions check out extending the library article. Connect to a different Web \u00b6 The new factory function allows you to create a connection to a different web maintaining the same setup as your existing interface. You have two options, either to 'AssignFrom' or 'CopyFrom' the base timeline's observers. The below example utilizes 'AssignFrom' but the method would be the same regadless of which route you choose. For more information on these behaviors see Core/Behaviors . import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { AssignFrom } from \"@pnp/core\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; //Connection to the current context's Web const sp = spfi().using(SPFx(this.context)); // Option 1: Create a new instance of Queryable const spWebB = spfi({Other Web URL}).using(SPDefault(this.context)); // Option 2: Copy/Assign a new instance of Queryable using the existing const spWebB = spfi({Other Web URL}).using(AssignFrom(sp.web)); // Option 3: Create a new instance of Queryable using other credentials? const spWebB = spfi({Other Web URL}).using(SPDefault(this.context)); Next Steps \u00b6 For more complicated authentication scnearios please review the article describing all of the available authentication methods .","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting-started/#getting-started","text":"This library is geared towards folks working with TypeScript but will work equally well for JavaScript projects.

For a full, detailed list of what's been added, updated, and removed please see our CHANGELOG Benefits and Advancements in V3 \u00b6 For version 2 the core themes were selective imports, a model based on factory functions & interfaces, and improving the docs. This foundation gave us the opportunity to re-write the entire request pipeline internals with minimal external library changes - showing a bit of long-term planning \ud83d\ude42. With version 3 your required updates are likely to only affect the initial configuration of the library, a huge accomplishment when updating the entire internals. Our request pipeline remained largely unchanged since it was first written ~5 years ago, hard to change something so central to the library. The advantage of this update it is now easy for developers to inject their own logic into the request process. As always, this work was based on feedback over the years and understanding how we can be a better library. The new observer design allows you to customize every aspect of the request, in a much clearer way than was previously possible. In addition this work greatly reduced internal boilerplate code and optimized for library size. We reduced the size of sp & graph libraries by almost 2/3. As well we embraced a fully async design built around the new Timeline . Check out the new model around authoring observers and understand how they relate to moments . We feel this new architecture will allow far greater flexibility for consumers of the library to customize the behavior to exactly meet their needs. We also used this as an opportunity to remove duplicate methods, clean up and improve our typings & method signatures, and drop legacy methods. Be sure to review the changelog . As always we do our best to minimize breaking changes but major versions are breaking versions. We thank you for using the library. Your continued feedback drives these improvements, and we look forward to seeing what you build! Global vs Instance Architecture \u00b6 The biggest change in version 3 of the library is the movement away from the globally defined sp and graph objects. Starting in version 2.1.0 we added the concept of Isolated Runtime which allowed you to create a separate instance of the global object that would have a separate configuration. We found that the implementation was finicky and prone to issues, so we have rebuilt the internals of the library from the ground up to better address this need. In doing so, we decided not to offer a global object at all. Because of this change, any architecture that relies on the sp or graph objects being configured during initialization and then reused throughout the solution will need to be rethought, either by creating a new spfi / graphfi object wherever it's required or by creating a service architecture that can return a previously configured instance or utilize an instance and return the results. Essentially the sp and graph objects have been deprecated and will need to be replaced. For more information on getting started with these new setup methods please see the Getting Started docs for a deeper look into the Queryable interface see Queryable . AssignFrom and CopyFrom \u00b6 With the new Querable instance architecture we have provided a way to branch from one instance to another. To do this we provide two methods: AssignFrom and CopyFrom. These methods can be helpful when you want to establish a new instance to which you might apply other behaviors but want to reuse the configuration from a source. To learn more about them check out the Core/Behaviors documentation. Dropping \".get()\" \u00b6 If you are still using the queryableInstance.get() method of queryable you must replace it with a direct invoke call queryableInstance() . Batching \u00b6 Another benefit of the new updated internals is a significantly streamlined and simplified process for batching requests. Essentially, the interface for SP and Graph now function the same. A new module called \"batching\" will need to be imported which then provides the batched interface which will return a tuple with a new Querable instance and an execute function. To see more details check out Batching . Web -> SPFI \u00b6 In V2, to connect to a different web you would use the function const web = Web({Other Web URL}); In V3 you would create a new instance of queryable connecting to the web of your choice. This new method provides you significantly more flexibility by not only allowing you to easily connect to other webs in the same tenant but also to webs in other tenants. const spWebA = spfi().using(SPDefault(this.context)); // Create a new instance of Queryable const spWebB = spfi(\"{Other Web URL}\").using(SPDefault(this.context)); // Copy/Assign a new instance of Queryable using the existing const spWebC = spfi(\"{Other Web URL}\").using(AssignFrom(sp.web)); // Create a new instance of Queryable using other credentials? const spWebD = spfi(\"{Other Web URL}\").using(SPDefault(this.context)); // as well you can use the tuple pattern and the Web contructor, which will copy all the observers from the object but set the url to the one provided const spWebE = Web([spWebA, \"{Other Web URL}\"]).using(SPDefault(this.context)); Dropping -Commonjs Packages \u00b6 Starting with v3 we are dropping the commonjs versions of all packages. Previously we released these as we worked to transition to esm and the current node didn't yet support esm. With esm now a supported module type, and having done the work to ensure they work in node we feel it is a good time to drop the -commonjs variants.","title":"V2->V3 Transition"},{"location":"transition-guide/#transition-guide","text":"It is our hope that the transition from version 2.* to 3.* will be as painless as possible, however given the transition we have made from a global sp object to an instance based object some architectural and inital setup changes will need to be addressed.

We feel this new architecture will allow far greater flexibility for consumers of the library to customize the behavior to exactly meet their needs. We also used this as an opportunity to remove duplicate methods, clean up and improve our typings & method signatures, and drop legacy methods. Be sure to review the changelog . As always we do our best to minimize breaking changes but major versions are breaking versions. We thank you for using the library. Your continued feedback drives these improvements, and we look forward to seeing what you build!","title":"Benefits and Advancements in V3"},{"location":"transition-guide/#global-vs-instance-architecture","text":"The biggest change in version 3 of the library is the movement away from the globally defined sp and graph objects. Starting in version 2.1.0 we added the concept of Isolated Runtime which allowed you to create a separate instance of the global object that would have a separate configuration. We found that the implementation was finicky and prone to issues, so we have rebuilt the internals of the library from the ground up to better address this need. In doing so, we decided not to offer a global object at all. Because of this change, any architecture that relies on the sp or graph objects being configured during initialization and then reused throughout the solution will need to be rethought, either by creating a new spfi / graphfi object wherever it's required or by creating a service architecture that can return a previously configured instance or utilize an instance and return the results. Essentially the sp and graph objects have been deprecated and will need to be replaced.

Tricks to help you figure out how to add first-party web parts to your page \u00b6 This section is to offer you methods to be able to reverse engineer some of the first party web parts to help figure out how to add them to the page using the addControl method. Your first step needs to be creating a test page that you can inspect. Create a new Site Page. Open the browser console, and navigate to the network tab Filter the network tab for Fetch/XHR and then type SavePage to filter for the specific network calls. Add and configure the web part you want to reverse engineer and then save the page as draft. The network tab will now show a SavePageAsDraft call and you can then look at the Payload of that call You then want to specifically look at the CanvasContent1 property and copy that value. You can then paste it into a temporary file with the .json extension in your code editor so you can inspect the payload. The value is an array of objects, and each object (except the last) is the definition of the web part. Below is an example (as of the last change date of this document) of what the QuickLinks web part looks like. One key takeaway from this file is the webPartId property which can be used when filtering for the right web part definition after getting a collection from sp.web.getClientsideWebParts(); .

It provides context on the error object, and ways to handle the errors. As always you should tailor your error handling to what your application needs. These are ideas that can be applied to many different patterns. For 429, 503, and 504 errors we include retry logic within the library The HttpRequestError \u00b6 All errors resulting from executed web requests will be returned as an HttpRequestError object which extends the base Error . In addition to the standard Error properties it has some other properties to help you figure out what went wrong. We used a custom error to attempt to normalize what can be a wide assortment of http related errors, while also seeking to provide as much information to library consumers as possible. Property Name Description name Standard Error.name property. Always 'Error' message Normalized string containing the status, status text, and the full response text stack The callstack producing the error isHttpRequestError Always true, allows you to reliably determine if you have an HttpRequestError instance response Unread copy of the Response object resulting in the thrown error status The Response.status value (such as 404) statusText The Response.statusText value (such as 'Not Found') Basic Handling \u00b6 For all operations involving a web request you should account for the possibility they might fail. That failure might be transient or permanent - you won't know until they happen \ud83d\ude09. The most basic type of error handling involves a simple try-catch when using the async/await promises pattern . import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists/web\"; try { // get a list that doesn't exist const w = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"no\")(); } catch (e) { console.error(e); } This will produce output like: Error making HttpClient request in queryable [404] Not Found ::> {\"odata.error\":{\"code\":\"-1, System.ArgumentException\",\"message\":{\"lang\":\"en-US\",\"value\":\"List 'no' does not exist at site with URL 'https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/dev'.\"}}} Data: {\"response\":{\"size\":0,\"timeout\":0},\"status\":404,\"statusText\":\"Not Found\",\"isHttpRequestError\":true} This is very descriptive and provides full details as to what happened, but you might want to handle things a little more cleanly. Reading the Response \u00b6 In some cases the response body will have additional details such as a localized error messages which can be nicer to display rather than our normalized string. You can read the response directly and process it however you desire: import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists/web\"; import { HttpRequestError } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; try { // get a list that doesn't exist const w = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"no\")(); } catch (e) { // are we dealing with an HttpRequestError? if (e?.isHttpRequestError) { // we can read the json from the response const json = await (<HttpRequestError>e).response.json(); // if we have a value property we can show it console.log(typeof json[\"odata.error\"] === \"object\" ? json[\"odata.error\"].message.value : e.message); // add of course you have access to the other properties and can make choices on how to act if ((<HttpRequestError>e).status === 404) { console.error((<HttpRequestError>e).statusText); // maybe create the resource, or redirect, or fallback to a secondary data source // just ideas, handle any of the status codes uniquely as needed } } else { // not an HttpRequestError so we just log message console.log(e.message); } } Logging errors \u00b6 Using the PnPjs Logging Framework you can directly pass the error object and the normalized message will be logged. These techniques can be applied to any logging framework. import { Logger } from \"@pnp/logging\"; import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists/web\"; try { // get a list that doesn't exist const w = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"no\")(); } catch (e) { Logger.error(e); } You may want to read the response and customize the message as described above: import { Logger } from \"@pnp/logging\"; import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists/web\"; import { HttpRequestError } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; try { // get a list that doesn't exist const w = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"no\")(); } catch (e) { if (e?.isHttpRequestError) { // we can read the json from the response const data = await (<HttpRequestError>e).response.json(); // parse this however you want const message = typeof data[\"odata.error\"] === \"object\" ? data[\"odata.error\"].message.value : e.message; // we use the status to determine a custom logging level const level: LogLevel = (<HttpRequestError>e).status === 404 ?

Before proceeding be sure you have reviewed how to setup for local configuration and debugging. Debugging Library Features \u00b6 The easiest way to debug the library when working on new features is using F5 in Visual Studio Code. This uses launch.json to build and run the library using ./debug/launch/main.ts as the entry point. Basic SharePoint Testing \u00b6 You can start the base debugging case by hitting F5. Before you do place a break point in ./debug/launch/sp.ts. You can also place a break point within any of the libraries or modules. Feel free to edit the sp.ts file to try things out, debug suspected issues, or test new features, etc - but please don't commit any changes as this is a shared file. See the section on creating your own debug modules . All of the setup for the node client is handled within sp.ts using the settings from the local configuration . Basic Graph Testing \u00b6 Testing and debugging Graph calls follows the same process as outlined for SharePoint, however you need to update main.ts to import graph instead of sp. You can place break points anywhere within the library code and they should be hit. All of the setup for the node client is handled within graph.ts using the settings from the local configuration . How to: Create a Debug Module \u00b6 If you are working on multiple features or want to save sample code for various tasks you can create your own debugging modules and leave them in the debug/launch folder locally. The gitignore file is setup to ignore any files that aren't already in git. Using ./debug/launch/sp.ts as a reference create a file in the debug/launch folder, let's call it mydebug.ts and add this content: // note we can use the actual package names for our imports (ex: @pnp/logging) import { Logger, LogLevel, ConsoleListener } from \"@pnp/logging\"; // using the all preset for simplicity in the example, selective imports work as expected import { sp, ListEnsureResult } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\"; declare var process: { exit(code?: number): void }; export async function MyDebug() { // configure your options // you can have different configs in different modules as needed for your testing/dev work sp.setup({ sp: { fetchClientFactory: () => { return new SPFetchClient(settings.testing.sp.url, settings.testing.sp.id, settings.testing.sp.secret); }, }, }); // run some debugging const list = await sp.web.lists.ensure(\"MyFirstList\"); Logger.log({ data: list.created, level: LogLevel.Info, message: \"Was list created?\", }); if (list.created) { Logger.log({ data: list.data, level: LogLevel.Info, message: \"Raw data from list creation.\", }); } else { Logger.log({ data: null, level: LogLevel.Info, message: \"List already existed!\", }); } process.exit(0); } Update main.ts to launch your module \u00b6 First comment out the import for the default example and then add the import and function call for yours, the updated launch/main.ts should look like this: // ... // comment out the example // import { Example } from \"./example\"; // Example(); import { MyDebug } from \"./mydebug\" MyDebug(); // ... Remember, please don't commit any changes to the shared files within the debug folder. (Unless you've found a bug that needs fixing in the original file) Debug \u00b6 Place a break point within the mydebug.ts file and hit F5. Your module should run and your break point hit. You can then examine the contents of the objects and see the run time state. Remember, you can also set breakpoints within the package src folders to see exactly how things are working during your debugging scenarios. Debug Module Next Steps \u00b6 Using this pattern you can create and preserve multiple debugging scenarios in separate modules locally - they won't be added to git. You just have to update main.ts to point to the one you want to run. In Browser Debugging \u00b6 You can also serve files locally to debug as a user in the browser by serving code using ./debug/serve/main.ts as the entry. The file is served as https://localhost:8080/assets/pnp.js , allowing you to create a single page in your tenant for in browser testing. The remainder of this section describes the process to setup a SharePoint page to debug in this manner. Start the local serve \u00b6 This will serve a package with ./debug/serve/main.ts as the entry. gulp serve Add reference to library \u00b6 Within a SharePoint page add a script editor web part and then paste in the following code. The div is to give you a place to target with visual updates should you desire. <script src=\"https://localhost:8080/assets/pnp.js\"></script> <div id=\"pnp-test\"></div> You should see an alert with the current web's title using the default main.ts. Feel free to update main.ts to do whatever you would like, but remember not to commit changes to the shared files. Debug \u00b6 Refresh the page and open the developer tools in your browser of choice. If the pnp.js file is blocked due to security restrictions you will need to allow it. Next Steps \u00b6 You can make changes to the library and immediately see them reflected in the browser. All files are watched so changes will be available as soon as webpack reloads the package.

At the most basic level PnPjs is a set of libraries used to build and execute a web request and handle the response from that request. Conceptually each object in the fluent chain serves as input when creating the next object in the chain. This is how configuration, url, query, and other values are passed along. To get a sense for what this looks like see the code below. This is taken from inside the webs submodule and shows how the \"webs\" property is added to the web class. // TypeScript property, returning an interface public get webs(): IWebs { // using the Webs factory function and providing \"this\" as the first parameter return Webs(this); } Understanding Factory Functions \u00b6 PnPjs v3 is designed to only expose interfaces and factory functions. Let's look at the Webs factory function, used above as an example. All factory functions in sp and graph have a similar form. // create a constant which is a function of type ISPInvokableFactory having the name Webs // this is bound by the generic type param to return an IWebs instance // and it will use the _Webs concrete class to form the internal type of the invocable export const Webs = spInvokableFactory<IWebs>(_Webs); The ISPInvokableFactory type looks like: export type ISPInvokableFactory<R = any> = (baseUrl: string | ISharePointQueryable, path?: string) => R; And the matching graph type: <R>(f: any): (baseUrl: string | IGraphQueryable, path?: string) => R The general idea of a factory function is that it takes two parameters. The first is either a string or Queryable derivative which forms base for the new object. The second is the next part of the url. In some cases (like the webs property example above) you will note there is no second parameter. Some classes are decorated with defaultPath, which automatically fills the second param. Don't worry too much right now about the deep internals of the library, let's instead focus on some concrete examples. import { Web } from \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; // create a web from an absolute url const web = Web(\"https://tenant.sharepoint.com\"); // as an example, create a new web using the first as a base // targets: https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/dev const web2 = Web(web, \"sites/dev\"); // or you can add any path components you want, here as an example we access the current user property const cu = Web(web, \"currentuser\"); const currentUserInfo = cu(); Now hey you might say - you can't create a request to current user using the Web factory. Well you can, since everything is just based on urls under the covers the actual factory names don't mean anything other than they have the appropriate properties and method hung off them. This is brought up as you will see in many cases objects being used to create queries within methods and properties that don't match their \"type\". It is an important concept when working with the library to always remember we are just building strings. Class structure \u00b6 Internally to the library we have a bit of complexity to make the whole invocable proxy architecture work and provide the typings folks expect. Here is an example implementation with extra comments explaining what is happening. You don't need to understand the entire stack to add a property or method /* The concrete class implementation. This is never exported or shown directly to consumers of the library. It is wrapped by the Proxy we do expose. It extends the _SharePointQueryableInstance class for which there is a matching _SharePointQueryableCollection. The generic parameter defines the return type of a get operation and the invoked result. Classes can have methods and properties as normal. This one has a single property as a simple example */ export class _HubSite extends _SharePointQueryableInstance<IHubSiteInfo> { /** * Gets the ISite instance associated with this hub site */ // the tag decorator is used to provide some additional telemetry on what methods are // being called. @tag(\"hs.getSite\") public async getSite(): Promise<ISite> { // we execute a request using this instance, selecting the SiteUrl property, and invoking it immediately and awaiting the result const d = await this.select(\"SiteUrl\")(); // we then return a new ISite instance created from the Site factory using the returned SiteUrl property as the baseUrl return Site(d.SiteUrl); } } /* This defines the interface we export and expose to consumers. In most cases this extends the concrete object but may add or remove some methods/properties in special cases */ export interface IHubSite extends _HubSite { } /* This defines the HubSite factory function as discussed above binding the spInvokableFactory to a generic param of IHubSite and a param of _HubSite. This is understood to mean that HubSite is a factory function that returns a types of IHubSite which the spInvokableFactory will create using _HubSite as the concrete underlying type. */ export const HubSite = spInvokableFactory<IHubSite>(_HubSite); Add a Property \u00b6 In most cases you won't need to create the class, interface, or factory - you just want to add a property or method. An example of this is sp.web.lists. web is a property of sp and lists is a property of web. You can have a look at those classes as examples. Let's have a look at the fields on the _View class. export class _View extends _SharePointQueryableInstance<IViewInfo> { // ... other code removed // add the property, and provide a return type // return types should be interfaces public get fields(): IViewFields { // we use the ViewFields factory function supplying \"this\" as the first parameter // this will create a url like \".../fields/viewfields\" due to the defaultPath decorator // on the _ViewFields class. This is equivalent to: ViewFields(this, \"viewfields\") return ViewFields(this); } // ... other code removed } There are many examples throughout the library that follow this pattern. Add a Method \u00b6 Adding a method is just like adding a property with the key difference that a method usually does something like make a web request or act like a property but take parameters. Let's look at the _Items getById method: @defaultPath(\"items\") export class _Items extends _SharePointQueryableCollection { /** * Gets an Item by id * * @param id The integer id of the item to retrieve */ // we declare a method and set the return type to an interface public getById(id: number): IItem { // here we use the tag helper to add some telemetry to our request // we create a new IItem using the factory and appending the id value to the end // this gives us a valid url path to a single item .../items/getById(2) // we can then use the returned IItem to extend our chain or execute a request return tag.configure(Item(this).concat(`(${id})`), \"is.getById\"); } // ... other code removed } Web Request Method \u00b6 A second example is a method that performs a request. Here we use the _Item recycle method as an example: /** * Moves the list item to the Recycle Bin and returns the identifier of the new Recycle Bin item. */ // we use the tag decorator to add telemetry @tag(\"i.recycle\") // we return a promise public recycle(): Promise<string> { // we use the spPost method to post the request created by cloning our current instance IItem using // the Item factory and adding the path \"recycle\" to the end. Url will look like .../items/getById(2)/recycle return spPost<string>(Item(this, \"recycle\")); } Augment Using Selective Imports \u00b6 To understand is how to extend functionality within the selective imports structures look at list.ts file in the items submodule. Here you can see the code below, with extra comments to explain what is happening. Again, you will see this pattern repeated throughout the library so there are many examples available. // import the addProp helper import { addProp } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; // import the _List concrete class from the types module (not the index!) import { _List } from \"../lists/types\"; // import the interface and factory we are going to add to the List import { Items, IItems } from \"./types\"; // This module declaration fixes up the types, allowing .items to appear in intellisense // when you import \"@pnp/sp/items/list\"; declare module \"../lists/types\" { // we need to extend the concrete type interface _List { readonly items: IItems; } // we need to extend the interface // this may not be strictly necessary as the IList interface extends _List so it // should pick up the same additions, but we have seen in some cases this does seem // to be required. So we include it for safety as it will all be removed during // transpilation we don't need to care about the extra code interface IList { readonly items: IItems; } } // finally we add the property to the _List class // this method call says add a property to _List named \"items\" and that property returns a result using the Items factory // The factory will be called with \"this\" when the property is accessed. If needed there is a fourth parameter to append additional path // information to the property url addProp(_List, \"items\", Items); General Rules for Extending PnPjs \u00b6 Only expose interfaces to consumers Use the factory functions except in very special cases Look for other properties and methods as examples Simple is always preferable, but not always possible - use your best judgement If you find yourself writing a ton of code to solve a problem you think should be easy, ask If you find yourself deep within the core classes or odata library trying to make a change, ask - changes to the core classes are rarely needed Next Steps \u00b6 Now that you have extended the library you need to write a test to cover it!","title":"Expanding the Library"},{"location":"contributing/extending-the-library/#extending-pnpjs","text":"This article is targeted at people wishing to extend PnPjs itself, usually by adding a method or property.

We want to call the graph, default to the beta endpoint, setup MSAL, and include a custom header we need for our environment. To do so we create a composed behavior consisting of graph's DefaultInit, graph's DefaultHeaders, nodejs's MSAL, nodejs's NodeFetchWithRetry, and queryable's DefaultParse & InjectHeaders. Then we can import this behavior into all our projects to configure them. company-default.ts import { TimelinePipe } from \"@pnp/core\"; import { DefaultParse, Queryable, InjectHeaders } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import { DefaultHeaders, DefaultInit } from \"@pnp/graph\"; import { NodeFetchWithRetry, MSAL } from \"@pnp/nodejs\"; export function CompanyDefault(): TimelinePipe<Queryable> { return (instance: Queryable) => { instance.using( // use the default headers DefaultHeaders(), // use the default init, but change the base url to beta DefaultInit(\"https://graph.microsoft.com/beta\"), // use node-fetch with retry NodeFetchWithRetry(), // use the default parsing DefaultParse(), // inject our special header to all requests InjectHeaders({ \"X-SomeSpecialToken\": \"{THE SPECIAL TOKEN VALUE}\", }), // setup node's MSAL with configuration from the environment (or any source) MSAL(process.env.MSAL_CONFIG)); return instance; }; } index.ts import { CompanyDefault } from \"./company-default.ts\"; import { graphfi } from \"@pnp/graph\"; // we can consistently and easily setup our graph instance using a single behavior const graph = graphfi().using(CompanyDefault()); You can easily share your composed behaviors across your projects using library components in SPFx , a company CDN, or an npm package. Core Behaviors \u00b6 This section describes two behaviors provided by the @pnp/core library, AssignFrom and CopyFrom. Likely you won't often need them directly - they are used in some places internally - but they are made available should they prove useful. AssignFrom \u00b6 This behavior creates a ref to the supplied Timeline implementation's observers and resets the inheriting flag. This means that changes to the parent, here being the supplied Timeline, will begin affecting the target to which this behavior is applied. import { spfi, SPBrowser } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { AssignFrom } from \"@pnp/core\"; // some local project file import { MyCustomeBehavior } from \"./behaviors.ts\"; const source = spfi().using(SPBrowser()); const target = spfi().using(MyCustomeBehavior()); // target will now hold a reference to the observers contained in source // changes to the subscribed observers in source will apply to target // anything that was added by \"MyCustomeBehavior\" will no longer be present target.using(AssignFrom(source)); // you can always apply additional behaviors or register directly on the events // but once you modify target it will not longer ref source and changes to source will no longer apply target.using(SomeOtherBehavior()); target.on.log(console.log); CopyFrom \u00b6 Similar to AssignFrom, this method creates a copy of all the observers on the source and applies them to the target. This can be done either as a replace or append operation using the second parameter. The default is \"append\". \"replace\" will first clear each source moment's registered observers then apply each in source-order via the on operation. \"append\" will apply each source moment's registered observers in source-order via the on operation By design CopyFrom does NOT include moments defined by symbol keys. import { spfi, SPBrowser } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { CopyFrom } from \"@pnp/core\"; // some local project file import { MyCustomeBehavior } from \"./behaviors.ts\"; const source = spfi().using(SPBrowser()); const target = spfi().using(MyCustomeBehavior()); // target will have the observers copied from source, but no reference to source.

Keep reading under Define Moments to understand more about what a moment is and how to create one. The easiest way to understand Timeline is to walk through implementing a simple one below. You also review Queryable to see how we use Timeline internally to the library. Create a Timeline \u00b6 Implementing a timeline involves several steps, each explained below. Define Moments Implement concrete Timeline class Define Moments \u00b6 A timeline is made up of a set of moments which are themselves defined by a plain object with one or more properties, each of which is a function. You can use predefined moments , or create your own to meet your exact requirements. Below we define two moments within the MyMoments object, first and second. These names are entirely your choice and the order moments are defined in the plain object carries no meaning. The first moment uses a pre-defined moment implementation asyncReduce . This moment allows you to define a state based on the arguments of the observer function, in this case FirstObserver . asyncReduce takes those arguments, does some processing, and returns a promise resolving an array matching the input arguments in order and type with optionally changed values. Those values become the arguments to the next observer registered to that moment. import { asyncReduce, ObserverAction, Timeline } from \"@pnp/core\"; // the first observer is a function taking a number and async returning a number in an array // all asyncReduce observers must follow this pattern of returning async a tuple matching the args export type FirstObserver = (this: any, counter: number) => Promise<[number]>; // the second observer is a function taking a number and returning void export type SecondObserver = (this: any, result: number) => void; // this is a custom moment definition as an example. export function report<T extends ObserverAction>(): (observers: T[], ...args: any[]) => void { return function (observers: T[], ...args: any[]): void { const obs = [...observers]; // for this if (obs.length > 0) { Reflect.apply(obs[0], this, args); } }; } // this plain object defines the moments which will be available in our timeline // the property name \"first\" and \"second\" will be the moment names, used when we make calls such as instance.on.first and instance.on.second const TestingMoments = { first: asyncReduce<FirstObserver>(), second: report<SecondObserver>(), } as const; // note as well the use of as const, this allows TypeScript to properly resolve all the complex typings and not treat the plain object as \"any\" Subclass Timeline \u00b6 After defining our moments we need to subclass Timeline to define how those moments emit through the lifecycle of the Timeline.

This article outlines how to setup logging and use the various loggers. Getting Started \u00b6 Install the logging module, it has no other dependencies npm install @pnp/logging --save Understanding the Logging Framework \u00b6 The logging framework is centered on the Logger class to which any number of listeners can be subscribed. Each of these listeners will receive each of the messages logged. Each listener must implement the ILogListener interface, shown below. There is only one method to implement and it takes an instance of the LogEntry interface as a parameter. /** * Interface that defines a log listener * */ export interface ILogListener { /** * Any associated data that a given logging listener may choose to log or ignore * * @param entry The information to be logged */ log(entry: ILogEntry): void; } /** * Interface that defines a log entry * */ export interface ILogEntry { /** * The main message to be logged */ message: string; /** * The level of information this message represents */ level: LogLevel; /** * Any associated data that a given logging listener may choose to log or ignore */ data?: any; } Log Levels \u00b6 export const enum LogLevel { Verbose = 0, Info = 1, Warning = 2, Error = 3, Off = 99, } Writing to the Logger \u00b6 To write information to a logger you can use either write, writeJSON, or log. import { Logger, LogLevel } from \"@pnp/logging\"; // write logs a simple string as the message value of the LogEntry Logger.write(\"This is logging a simple string\"); // optionally passing a level, default level is Verbose Logger.write(\"This is logging a simple string\", LogLevel.Error); // this will convert the object to a string using JSON.stringify and set the message with the result Logger.writeJSON({ name: \"value\", name2: \"value2\"}); // optionally passing a level, default level is Verbose Logger.writeJSON({ name: \"value\", name2: \"value2\"}, LogLevel.Warning); // specify the entire LogEntry interface using log Logger.log({ data: { name: \"value\", name2: \"value2\"}, level: LogLevel.Warning, message: \"This is my message\" }); Log an error \u00b6 There exists a shortcut method to log an error to the Logger. This will log an entry to the subscribed loggers where the data property will be the Error instance passed in, the level will be 'Error', and the message will be the Error instance's message property. const e = Error(\"An Error\"); Logger.error(e); Subscribing a Listener \u00b6 By default no listeners are subscribed, so if you would like to get logging information you need to subscribe at least one listener. This is done as shown below by importing the Logger and your listener(s) of choice. Here we are using the provided ConsoleListener. We are also setting the active log level, which controls the level of logging that will be output. Be aware that Verbose produces a substantial amount of data about each request. import { Logger, ConsoleListener, LogLevel } from \"@pnp/logging\"; // subscribe a listener Logger.subscribe(new ConsoleListener()); // set the active log level Logger.activeLogLevel = LogLevel.Info; Available Listeners \u00b6 There are two listeners included in the library, ConsoleListener and FunctionListener. ConsoleListener \u00b6 This listener outputs information to the console and works in Node as well as within browsers. It can be used without settings and writes to the appropriate console method based on message level. For example a LogEntry with level Warning will be written to console.warn. Basic usage is shown in the example above. Configuration Options \u00b6 Although ConsoleListener can be used without configuration, there are some additional options available to you. ConsoleListener supports adding a prefix to every output (helpful for filtering console messages) and specifying text color for messages (including by LogLevel). Using a Prefix \u00b6 To add a prefix to all output, supply a string in the constructor: import { Logger, ConsoleListener, LogLevel } from \"@pnp/logging\"; const LOG_SOURCE: string = 'MyAwesomeWebPart'; Logger.subscribe(new ConsoleListener(LOG_SOURCE)); Logger.activeLogLevel = LogLevel.Info; With the above configuration, Logger.write(\"My special message\"); will be output to the console as: MyAwesomeWebPart - My special message Customizing Text Color \u00b6 You can also specify text color for your messages by supplying an IConsoleListenerColors object. You can simply specify color to set the default color for all logging levels or you can set one or more logging level specific text colors (if you only want to set color for a specific logging level(s), leave color out and all other log levels will use the default color). Colors can be specified the same way color values are specified in CSS (named colors, hex values, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, etc.): import { Logger, ConsoleListener, LogLevel } from \"@pnp/logging\"; const LOG_SOURCE: string = 'MyAwesomeWebPart'; Logger.subscribe(new ConsoleListener(LOG_SOURCE, {color:'#0b6a0b',warningColor:'magenta'})); Logger.activeLogLevel = LogLevel.Info; With the above configuration: Logger.write(\"My special message\"); Logger.write(\"A warning!\", LogLevel.Warning); Will result in messages that look like this: Color options: color : Default text color for all logging levels unless they're specified verboseColor : Text color to use for messages with LogLevel.Verbose infoColor : Text color to use for messages with LogLevel.Info warningColor : Text color to use for messages with LogLevel.Warning errorColor : Text color to use for messages with LogLevel.Error To set colors without a prefix, specify either undefined or an empty string for the first parameter: Logger.subscribe(new ConsoleListener(undefined, {color:'purple'})); FunctionListener \u00b6 The FunctionListener allows you to wrap any functionality by creating a function that takes a LogEntry as its single argument. This produces the same result as implementing the LogListener interface, but is useful if you already have a logging method or framework to which you want to pass the messages. import { Logger, FunctionListener, ILogEntry } from \"@pnp/logging\"; let listener = new FunctionListener((entry: ILogEntry) => { // pass all logging data to an existing framework MyExistingCompanyLoggingFramework.log(entry.message); }); Logger.subscribe(listener); Create a Custom Listener \u00b6 If desirable for your project you can create a custom listener to perform any logging action you would like. This is done by implementing the ILogListener interface. import { Logger, ILogListener, ILogEntry } from \"@pnp/logging\"; class MyListener implements ILogListener { log(entry: ILogEntry): void { // here you would do something with the entry } } Logger.subscribe(new MyListener()); Logging Behavior \u00b6 To allow seamless logging with v3 we have introduced the PnPLogging behavior. It takes a single augument representing the log level of that behavior , allowing you to be very selective in what logging you want to get. As well the log level applied here ignores any global level set with activeLogLevel on Logger. import { LogLevel, PnPLogging, Logger, ConsoleListener } from \"@pnp/logging\"; import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; // subscribe a listener Logger.subscribe(new ConsoleListener()); // at the root we only want to log errors, which will be sent to all subscribed loggers on Logger const sp = spfi().using(SPFx(this.context), PnPLogging(LogLevel.Error)); const list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"My List\"); // use verbose logging with this particular list because you are trying to debug something list.using(PnPLogging(LogLevel.Verbose)); const listData = await list();","title":"logging"},{"location":"logging/#pnplogging","text":"The logging module provides light weight subscribable and extensible logging framework which is used internally and available for use in your projects.

This year has marked usage milestones, seen more contributors than ever, and expanded the core maintainers team. But none of this would be possible without everyones support and participation - so we start by saying Thank You! We deeply appreciate everyone that has used, helped us grow, and improved the library over the last year. This year we introduced MSAL clients for node and browser, improved our testing/local development plumbing, and updated the libraries to work with the node 15 module resolution rules. We fixed 43 reported bugs, answered 131 questions, and made 55 suggested enhancements to the library - all driven by feedback from users and the community. Planned for release in January 2021 we also undertook the work to enable isolated runtimes, a long requested feature. This allows you to operate on multiple independently configured \"roots\" such as \"sp\" or \"graph\" from the same application. Previously the library was configured globally, so this opens new possibilities for both client and server side scenarios. Finally we made many tooling and project improvements such as moving to GitHub actions, updating the tests to use MSAL, and exploring ways to enhance the developer experience. Usage \u00b6 In 2020 we tracked steady month/month growth in raw usage measured by requests as well as in the number of tenants deploying the library. Starting the year we were used in 14605 tenants and by December that number grew to 21,227. These tenants generated 6.1 billion requests to the service in January growing to 9.2 billion by December, peaking at 10.1 billion requests in November. 1) There was a data glitch in October so the numbers do not fully represent usage. 2) These numbers only include public cloud SPO usage, true usage is higher than we can track due to on-premesis and gov/sovereign clouds Releases \u00b6 We continued our monthly release cadence as it represents a good pace for addressing issues while not expecting folks to update too often and keeping each update to a reasonable size. All changes can be tracked in our change log , updated with each release. You can check our scheduled releases through project milestones , understanding there are occasionally delays. Monthly releases allows us to ensure bugs do not linger and we continually improve and expand the capabilities of the libraries.

Additionally, we are beginning to discuss v3 and doing initial planning and prototyping. The v3 work will continue through 2021 with no currently set release date, though we will keep everyone up to date. Additionally in 2021 there will be a general focus on improving not just the code but our tooling, build pipeline, and library contributor experience. We will also look at automatic canary releases with each merge, and other improvements. New Lead Maintainer \u00b6 With the close of 2020 we are very excited to announce a new lead maintainer for PnPjs, Julie Turner ! Julie brings deep expertise with SharePoint Framework, TypeScript, and SharePoint development to the team, coupled with dedication and care in the work. Over the last year she has gotten more involved with handling releases, responding to issues, and helping to keep the code updated and clean. We are very lucky to have her working on the project and look forward to seeing her lead the growth and direction for years to come. Contributors \u00b6 As always we have abundant thanks and appreciation for your contributors. Taking your time to help improve PnPjs for the community is massive and valuable to ensure our sustainability. Thank you for all your help in 2020! If you are interested in becoming a contributor check out our guide on ways to get started. Sponsors \u00b6 We want to thank our sponsors for their support in 2020! This year we put the money towards helping offset the cost and shipping of hoodies to contributors and sponsors. Your continued generosity makes a big difference in our ability to recognize and reward the folks building PnPjs.

The goal is to deliver a much improved and flexible experience and none of that would have been possible without the support and participation of everyone in the PnP community - so we start by saying Thank You! We deeply appreciate everyone that has used, helped us grow, and improved the library over the last year. Because of the huge useage we've seen with the library and issues we found implementing some of the much requested enhancements, we felt we really needed to start from the ground up and rearchitect the library completely. This new design, built on the concept of a \"Timeline\", enabled us to build a significantly lighter weight solution that is more extensible than ever. And bonus, we were able to keep the overall development experience largly unchanged, so that makes transitioning all that much easier. In addition we took extra effort to validate our development efforts by making sure all our tests passed so that we could better ensure quality of the library. Check out our Transition Guide and ChangeLog for all the details. In other news, we fixed 47 reported bugs, answered 89 questions, and made 51 suggested enhancements to version 2 of the library - all driven by feedback from users and the community. Usage \u00b6 In 2021 we transitioned from rapid growth to slower growth but maintaining a request/month rate over 11 billion, approaching 13 billion by the end of the year. These requests came from more than 25 thousand tenants including some of the largest M365 customers. Due to some data cleanup we don't have the full year's information, but the below graph shows the final 7 months of the year. Releases \u00b6 We continued our monthly release cadence as it represents a good pace for addressing issues while not expecting folks to update too often and keeping each update to a reasonable size. All changes can be tracked in our change log , updated with each release. You can check our scheduled releases through project milestones , understanding there are occasionally delays. Monthly releases allows us to ensure bugs do not linger and we continually improve and expand the capabilities of the libraries.

Please also see available behaviors in @pnp/core , @pnp/nodejs , @pnp/sp , and @pnp/graph . Generally you won't need to use these behaviors individually when using the defaults supplied by the library, but when appropriate you can create your own composed behaviors using these as building blocks. Bearer Token \u00b6 Allows you to inject an existing bearer token into the request. This behavior will not replace any existing authentication behaviors, so you may want to ensure they are cleared if you are supplying your own tokens, regardless of their source.

It replaces any other registered observers on the send moment by default, but this can be controlled via the props. Remember, when registering observers on the send moment only the first one will be used so not replacing For fetch configuration in nodejs please see @pnp/nodejs behaviors . import { BrowserFetch } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(BrowserFetch()); const webInfo = await sp.webs(); import { BrowserFetch } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(BrowserFetch({ replace: false })); const webInfo = await sp.webs(); BrowserFetchWithRetry \u00b6 This behavior makes fetch requests but will attempt to retry the request on certain failures such as throttling. import { BrowserFetchWithRetry } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(BrowserFetchWithRetry()); const webInfo = await sp.webs(); You can also control how the behavior works through its props.

If neither is available (such as in Nodejs) the library will shim using an in memory map. It is a good idea to include caching in your projects to improve performance. By default items in the cache will expire after 5 minutes. import { Caching } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(Caching()); // caching will save the data into session storage on the first request - the key is based on the full url including query strings const webInfo = await sp.webs(); // caching will retriece this value from the cache saving a network requests the second time it is loaded (either in the same page, a reload of the page, etc.) const webInfo2 = await sp.webs(); Custom Key Function \u00b6 You can also supply custom functionality to control how keys are generated and calculate the expirations. The cache key factory has the form (url: string) => string and you must ensure your keys are unique enough that you won't have collisions. The expire date factory has the form (url: string) => Date and should return the Date when the cached data should expire. If you know that some particular data won't expire often you can set this date far in the future, or for more frequently updated information you can set it lower. If you set the expiration too short there is no reason to use caching as any stored information will likely always be expired. Additionally, you can set the storage to use local storage which will persist across sessions. import { getHashCode, PnPClientStorage, dateAdd, TimelinePipe } from \"@pnp/core\"; import { Caching } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(Caching({ store: \"local\", // use a hascode for the key keyFactory: (url) => getHashCode(url.toLowerCase()).toString(), // cache for one minute expireFunc: (url) => dateAdd(new Date(), \"minute\", 1), })); // caching will save the data into session storage on the first request - the key is based on the full url including query strings const webInfo = await sp.webs(); // caching will retriece this value from the cache saving a network requests the second time it is loaded (either in the same page, a reload of the page, etc.) const webInfo2 = await sp.webs(); As with any behavior you have the option to only apply caching to certain requests: import { getHashCode, dateAdd } from \"@pnp/core\"; import { Caching } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(); // caching will only apply to requests using `cachingList` as the base of the fluent chain const cachingList = sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"{List Title}\").using(Caching()); // caching will save the data into session storage on the first request - the key is based on the full url including query strings const itemsInfo = await cachingList.items(); // caching will retriece this value from the cache saving a network requests the second time it is loaded (either in the same page, a reload of the page, etc.) const itemsInfo2 = await cachingList.items(); Caching Pessimistic Refresh \u00b6 This behavior is slightly different than our default Caching behavior in that it will always return the cached value if there is one, but also asyncronously update the cached value in the background. Like the default CAchine behavior it allows you to cache the results of get requests in either session or local storage. If neither is available (such as in Nodejs) the library will shim using an in memory map. If you do not provide an expiration function then the cache will be updated asyncronously on every call, if you do provide an expiration then the cached value will only be updated, although still asyncronously, only when the cache has expired. import { CachingPessimisticRefresh } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(CachingPessimisticRefresh()); // caching will save the data into session storage on the first request - the key is based on the full url including query strings const webInfo = await sp.webs(); // caching will retriece this value from the cache saving a network requests the second time it is loaded (either in the same page, a reload of the page, etc.) const webInfo2 = await sp.webs(); Again as with the default Caching behavior you can provide custom functions for key generation and expiration. Please see the Custom Key Function documentation above for more details. InjectHeaders \u00b6 Adds any specified headers to a given request. Can be used multiple times with a timeline. The supplied headers are added to all requests, and last applied wins - meaning if two InjectHeaders are included in the pipeline which inlcude a value for the same header, the second one applied will be used. import { InjectHeaders } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(InjectHeaders({ \"X-Something\": \"a value\", \"MyCompanySpecialAuth\": \"special company token\", })); const webInfo = await sp.webs(); Parsers \u00b6 Parsers convert the returned fetch Response into something usable. We have included the most common parsers we think you'll need - but you can always write your own parser based on the signature of the parse moment . All of these parsers when applied through using will replace any other observers on the parse moment. DefaultParse \u00b6 Performs error handling and parsing of JSON responses. This is the one you'll use for most of your requests and it is included in all the defaults. import { DefaultParse } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(DefaultParse()); const webInfo = await sp.webs(); TextParse \u00b6 Checks for errors and parses the results as text with no further manipulation. import { TextParse } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(TextParse()); BlobParse \u00b6 Checks for errors and parses the results a Blob with no further manipulation. import { BlobParse } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(BlobParse()); JSONParse \u00b6 Checks for errors and parses the results as JSON with no further manipulation. Meaning you will get the raw JSON response vs DefaultParse which will remove wrapping JSON. import { JSONParse } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(JSONParse()); BufferParse \u00b6 Checks for errors and parses the results a Buffer with no further manipulation. import { BufferParse } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(BufferParse()); HeaderParse \u00b6 Checks for errors and parses the headers of the Response as the result. This is a specialised parses which can be used in those infrequent scenarios where you need information from the headers of a response. import { HeaderParse } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(HeaderParse()); Resolvers \u00b6 These two behaviors are special and should always be included when composing your own defaults. They implement the expected behavior of resolving or rejecting the promise returned when executing a timeline. They are implemented as behaviors should there be a need to do something different the logic is not locked into the core of the library. ResolveOnData, RejectOnError \u00b6 import { ResolveOnData, RejectOnError } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(ResolveOnData(), RejectOnError()); Timeout \u00b6 The Timeout behavior allows you to include a timeout in requests. You can specify either a number, representing the number of milliseconds until the request should timeout or an AbortSignal. In Nodejs you will need to polyfill AbortController if your version (<15) does not include it when using Timeout and passing a number. If you are supplying your own AbortSignal you do not. import { Timeout } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; // requests should timeout in 5 seconds const sp = spfi().using(Timeout(5000)); import { Timeout } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const controller = new AbortController(); const sp = spfi().using(Timeout(controller.signal)); // abort requests after 6 seconds using our own controller const timer = setTimeout(() => { controller.abort(); }, 6000); // this request will be cancelled if it doesn't complete in 6 seconds const webInfo = await sp.webs(); // be a good citizen and cancel unneeded timers clearTimeout(timer);","title":"Behaviors"},{"location":"queryable/behaviors/#pnpqueryable-behaviors","text":"The article describes the behaviors exported by the @pnp/queryable library.

This can be useful for debugging, testing, or injecting custom functionality. Extensions work with any invokable and allow you to control any behavior of the library with extensions. Types of Extensions \u00b6 There are two types of Extensions available as well as three methods for registration. You can register any type of extension with any of the registration options. Function Extensions \u00b6 The first type is a simple function with a signature: (op: \"apply\" | \"get\" | \"has\" | \"set\", target: T, ...rest: any[]): void This function is passed the current operation as the first argument, currently one of \"apply\", \"get\", \"has\", or \"set\". The second argument is the target instance upon which the operation is being invoked. The remaining parameters vary by the operation being performed, but will match their respective ProxyHandler method signatures. Named Extensions \u00b6 Named extensions are designed to add or replace a single property or method, though you can register multiple using the same object. These extensions are defined by using an object which has the property/methods you want to override described. Registering named extensions globally will override that operation to all invokables. import { extendFactory } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import { sp, List, Lists, IWeb, ILists, List, IList, Web } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\"; import { escapeQueryStrValue } from \"@pnp/sp/utils/escapeQueryStrValue\"; // create a plain object with the props and methods we want to add/change const myExtensions = { // override the lists property get lists(this: IWeb): ILists { // we will always order our lists by title and select just the Title for ALL calls (just as an example) return Lists(this).orderBy(\"Title\").select(\"Title\"); }, // override the getByTitle method getByTitle: function (this: ILists, title: string): IList { // in our example our list has moved, so we rewrite the request on the fly if (title === \"List1\") { return List(this, `getByTitle('List2')`); } else { // you can't at this point call the \"base\" method as you will end up in loop within the proxy // so you need to ensure you patch/include any original functionality you need return List(this, `getByTitle('${escapeQueryStrValue(title)}')`); } }, }; // register all the named Extensions extendFactory(Web, myExtensions); // this will use our extension to ensure the lists are ordered const lists = await sp.web.lists(); console.log(JSON.stringify(lists, null, 2)); // we will get the items from List1 but within the extension it is rewritten as List2 const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"List1\").items(); console.log(JSON.stringify(items.length, null, 2)); ProxyHandler Extensions \u00b6 You can also register a partial ProxyHandler implementation as an extension. You can implement one or more of the ProxyHandler methods as needed. Here we implement the same override of getByTitle globally. This is the most complicated method of creating an extension and assumes an understanding of how ProxyHandlers work. import { extendFactory } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import { sp, Lists, IWeb, ILists, Web } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\"; import { escapeQueryStrValue } from \"@pnp/sp/utils/escapeSingleQuote\"; const myExtensions = { get: (target, p: string | number | symbol, _receiver: any) => { switch (p) { case \"getByTitle\": return (title: string) => { // in our example our list has moved, so we rewrite the request on the fly if (title === \"LookupList\") { return List(target, `getByTitle('OrderByList')`); } else { // you can't at this point call the \"base\" method as you will end up in loop within the proxy // so you need to ensure you patch/include any original functionality you need return List(target, `getByTitle('${escapeQueryStrValue(title)}')`); } }; } }, }; extendFactory(Web, myExtensions); const lists = sp.web.lists; const items = await lists.getByTitle(\"LookupList\").items(); console.log(JSON.stringify(items.length, null, 2)); Registering Extensions \u00b6 You can register Extensions on an invocable factory or on a per-object basis, and you can register a single extension or an array of Extensions. Factory Registration \u00b6 The pattern you will likely find most useful is the ability to extend an invocable factory. This will apply your extensions to all instances created with that factory, meaning all IWebs or ILists will have the extension methods. The example below shows how to add a property to IWeb as well as a method to IList. import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists/web\"; import { IWeb, Web } from \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import { ILists, Lists } from \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import { extendFactory } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\"; // sets up the types correctly when importing across your application declare module \"@pnp/sp/webs/types\" { // we need to extend the interface interface IWeb { orderedLists: ILists; } } // sets up the types correctly when importing across your application declare module \"@pnp/sp/lists/types\" { // we need to extend the interface interface ILists { getOrderedListsQuery: (this: ILists) => ILists; } } extendFactory(Web, { // add an ordered lists property get orderedLists(this: IWeb): ILists { return this.lists.getOrderedListsQuery(); }, }); extendFactory(Lists, { // add an ordered lists property getOrderedListsQuery(this: ILists): ILists { return this.top(10).orderBy(\"Title\").select(\"Title\"); }, }); // regardless of how we access the web and lists collections our extensions remain with all new instance based on const web = Web(\"https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/dev/\"); const lists1 = await web.orderedLists(); console.log(JSON.stringify(lists1, null, 2)); const lists2 = await Web(\"https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/dev/\").orderedLists(); console.log(JSON.stringify(lists2, null, 2)); const lists3 = await sp.web.orderedLists(); console.log(JSON.stringify(lists3, null, 2)); Instance Registration \u00b6 You can also register Extensions on a single object instance, which is often the preferred approach as it will have less of a performance impact across your whole application. This is useful for debugging, overriding methods/properties, or controlling the behavior of specific object instances. Extensions are not transferred to child objects in a fluent chain, be sure you are extending the instance you think you are. Here we show the same override operation of getByTitle on the lists collection, but safely only overriding the single instance. import { extendObj } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import { sp, List, ILists } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\"; const myExtensions = { getByTitle: function (this: ILists, title: string) { // in our example our list has moved, so we rewrite the request on the fly if (title === \"List1\") { return List(this, \"getByTitle('List2')\"); } else { // you can't at this point call the \"base\" method as you will end up in loop within the proxy // so you need to ensure you patch/include any original functionality you need return List(this, `getByTitle('${escapeQueryStrValue(title)}')`); } }, }; const lists = extendObj(sp.web.lists, myExtensions); const items = await lists.getByTitle(\"LookupList\").items(); console.log(JSON.stringify(items.length, null, 2)); Enable & Disable Extensions and Clear Global Extensions \u00b6 Extensions are automatically enabled when you set an extension through any of the above outlined methods.

As a background to understand more of the mechanics please see the articles on Timeline , moments , and observers . For reuse it is recommended to compose your observer registrations with behaviors . Queryable Constructor \u00b6 By design the library is meant to allow creating the next part of a url from the current part. In this way each queryable instance is built from a previous instance. As such understanding the Queryable constructor's behavior is important. The constructor takes two parameters, the first required and the second optional. The first parameter can be another queryable, a string, or a tuple of [Queryable, string]. |Parameter|Behavior| |---|---| |Queryable|The new queryable inherits all of the supplied queryable's observers. Any supplied path (second constructor param) is appended to the supplied queryable's url becoming the url of the newly constructed queryable| |string|The new queryable will have NO registered observers. Any supplied path (second constructor param) is appended to the string becoming the url of the newly constructed queryable| |[Queryable, string]|The observers from the supplied queryable are used by the new queryable. The url is a combination of the second tuple argument (string) and any supplied path. The tuple constructor call can be used to rebase a queryable to call a different host in an otherwise identical way to another queryable. Queryable Lifecycle \u00b6 The Queryable lifecycle is: init pre auth send parse post data dispose As well log and error can emit at any point during the lifecycle. Queryable Observers \u00b6 This section outlines how to write observers for the Queryable lifecycle, and the expectations of each moment's observer behaviors. In the below samples consider the variable query to mean any valid Queryable derived object. log \u00b6 Anything can log to a given timeline's log using the public log method and to intercept those message you can subscribed to the log event. The log observer's signature is: (this: Timeline<T>, message: string, level: number) => void query.on.log((message, level) => { // log only warnings or errors if (level > 1) { console.log(message); } }); The level value is a number indicating the severity of the message. Internally we use the values from the LogLevel enum in @pnp/logging: Verbose = 0, Info = 1, Warning = 2, Error = 3. Be aware that nothing enforces those values other than convention and log can be called with any value for level. As well we provide easy support to use PnP logging within a Timeline derived class: import { LogLevel, PnPLogging } from \"@pnp/logging\"; // any messages of LogLevel Info or higher (1) will be logged to all subscribers of the logging framework query.using(PnPLogging(LogLevel.Info)); More details on the pnp logging framework error \u00b6 Errors can happen at anytime and for any reason. If you are using the RejectOnError behavior, and both sp and graph include that in the defaults, the request promise will be rejected as expected and you can handle the error that way. The error observer's signature is: (this: Timeline<T>, err: string | Error) => void import { spfi, DefaultInit, DefaultHeaders } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { BrowserFetchWithRetry, DefaultParse } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(DefaultInit(), DefaultHeaders(), BrowserFetchWithRetry(), DefaultParse()); try { const result = await sp.web(); } catch(e) { // any errors emitted will result in the promise being rejected // and ending up in the catch block as expected } In addition to the default behavior you can register your own observers on error , though it is recommended you leave the default behavior in place. query.on.error((err) => { if (err) { console.error(err); // do other stuff with the error (send it to telemetry) } }); init \u00b6 Along with dispose , init is a special moment that occurs before any of the other lifecycle providing a first chance at doing any tasks before the rest of the lifecycle starts. It is not await aware so only sync operations are supported in init by design. The init observer's signature is: (this: Timeline<T>) => void In the case of init you manipulate the Timeline instance itself query.on.init(function (this: Queryable) { // init is a great place to register additioanl observers ahead of the lifecycle this.on.pre(async function (this: Quyerable, url, init, result) { // stuff happens return [url, init, result]; }); }); pre \u00b6 Pre is used by observers to configure the request before sending. Note there is a dedicated auth moment which is prefered by convention to handle auth related tasks. The pre observer's signature is: (this: IQueryable, url: string, init: RequestInit, result: any) => Promise<[string, RequestInit, any]> The pre , auth , parse , and post are asyncReduce moments, meaning you are expected to always asyncronously return a tuple of the arguments supplied to the function. These are then passed to the next observer registered to the moment. Example of when to use pre are updates to the init, caching scenarios, or manipulation of the url (ensuring it is absolute). The init passed to pre (and auth) is the same object that will be eventually passed to fetch, meaning you can add any properties/congifuration you need. The result should always be left undefined unless you intend to end the lifecycle. If pre completes and result has any value other than undefined that value will be emitted to data and the timeline lifecycle will end. query.on.pre(async function(url, init, result) { init.cache = \"no-store\"; return [url, init, result]; }); query.on.pre(async function(url, init, result) { // setting result causes no moments after pre to be emitted other than data // once data is emitted (resolving the request promise by default) the lifecycle ends result = \"My result\"; return [url, init, result]; }); auth \u00b6 Auth functions very much like pre except it does not have the option to set the result, and the url is considered immutable by convention. Url manipulation should be done in pre. Having a seperate moment for auth allows for easily changing auth specific behavior without having to so a lot of complicated parsing of pre observers. The auth observer's signature is: (this: IQueryable, url: URL, init: RequestInit) => Promise<[URL, RequestInit]> . The pre , auth , parse , and post are asyncReduce moments, meaning you are expected to always asyncronously return a tuple of the arguments supplied to the function. These are then passed to the next observer registered to the moment. query.on.auth(async function(url, init) { // some code to get a token const token = getToken(); init.headers[\"Authorization\"] = `Bearer ${token}`; return [url, init]; }); send \u00b6 Send is implemented using the request moment which uses the first registered observer and invokes it expecting an async Response. The send observer's signature is: (this: IQueryable, url: URL, init: RequestInit) => Promise<Response> . query.on.send(async function(url, init) { // this could represent reading a file, querying a database, or making a web call return fetch(url.toString(), init); }); parse \u00b6 Parse is responsible for turning the raw Response into something usable. By default we handle errors and parse JSON responses, but any logic could be injected here. Perhaps your company encrypts things and you need to decrypt them before parsing further. The parse observer's signature is: (this: IQueryable, url: URL, response: Response, result: any | undefined) => Promise<[URL, Response, any]> . The pre , auth , parse , and post are asyncReduce moments, meaning you are expected to always asyncronously return a tuple of the arguments supplied to the function. These are then passed to the next observer registered to the moment. // you should be careful running multiple parse observers so we replace with our functionality // remember every registered observer is run, so if you set result and a later observer sets a // different value last in wins. query.on.parse.replace(async function(url, response, result) { if (response.ok) { result = await response.json(); } else { // just an example throw Error(response.statusText); } return [url, response, result]; }); post \u00b6 Post is run after parse, meaning you should have a valid fully parsed result, and provides a final opportunity to do caching, some final checks, or whatever you might need immediately prior to the request promise resolving with the value. It is recommened to NOT manipulate the result within post though nothing prevents you from doing so. The post observer's signature is: (this: IQueryable, url: URL, result: any | undefined) => Promise<[URL, any]> . The pre , auth , parse , and post are asyncReduce moments, meaning you are expected to always asyncronously return a tuple of the arguments supplied to the function. These are then passed to the next observer registered to the moment. query.on.post(async function(url, result) { // here we do some caching of a result const key = hash(url); cache(key, result); return [url, result]; }); data \u00b6 Data is called with the result of the Queryable lifecycle produced by send , understood by parse , and passed through post . By default the request promise will resolve with the value, but you can add any additional observers you need. The data observer's signature is: (this: IQueryable, result: T) => void . Clearing the data moment (ie. .on.data.clear()) after the lifecycle has started will result in the request promise never resolving query.on.data(function(result) { console.log(`Our result! ${JSON.stringify(result)}`); }); dispose \u00b6 Along with init , dispose is a special moment that occurs after all other lifecycle moments have completed. It is not await aware so only sync operations are supported in dispose by design. The dispose observer's signature is: (this: Timeline<T>) => void In the case of dispose you manipulate the Timeline instance itself query.on.dispose(function (this: Queryable) { // maybe your queryable calls a database? db.connection.close(); }); Other Methods \u00b6 Queryable exposes some additional methods beyond the observer registration. concat \u00b6 Appends the supplied string to the url without mormalizing slashes. // url: something.com/items query.concat(\"(ID)\"); // url: something.com/items(ID) toRequestUrl \u00b6 Converts the queryable's internal url parameters (url and query) into a relative or absolute url. const s = query.toRequestUrl(); query \u00b6 Map used to manage any query string parameters that will be included. Anything added here will be represented in toRequestUrl 's output. query.query.add(\"$select\", \"Title\"); toUrl \u00b6 Returns the url currently represented by the Queryable, without the querystring part const s = query.toUrl();","title":"Queryable"},{"location":"queryable/queryable/#pnpqueryablequeryable","text":"Queryable is the base class for both the sp and graph fluent interfaces and provides the structure to which observers are registered.

It is also your responsibility to ensure that the aliases you supply do not conflict, for example if you use \"@p1\" you should use \"@p2\" for a second parameter alias in the same query.","title":"@pnp/sp - Aliased Parameters"},{"location":"sp/alias-parameters/#construct-a-parameter-alias","text":"Pattern: !@{label name}::{value} Example: \"!@p1::\\sites\\dev\" or \"!@p2::\\text.txt\"","title":"Construct a parameter alias"},{"location":"sp/alias-parameters/#example-without-aliasing","text":"import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; import \"@pnp/sp/folders\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // still works as expected, no aliasing const query = sp.web.getFolderByServerRelativeUrl(\"/sites/dev/Shared Documents/\").files.select(\"Title\").top(3); console.log(query.toUrl()); // _api/web/getFolderByServerRelativeUrl('/sites/dev/Shared Documents/')/files console.log(query.toRequestUrl()); // _api/web/getFolderByServerRelativeUrl('/sites/dev/Shared Documents/')/files?$select=Title&$top=3 const r = await query(); console.log(r);","title":"Example without aliasing"},{"location":"sp/alias-parameters/#example-with-aliasing","text":"import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; import \"@pnp/sp/folders\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // same query with aliasing const query = sp.web.getFolderByServerRelativeUrl(\"!@p1::/sites/dev/Shared Documents/\").files.select(\"Title\").top(3); console.log(query.toUrl()); // _api/web/getFolderByServerRelativeUrl('!@p1::/sites/dev/Shared Documents/')/files console.log(query.toRequestUrl()); // _api/web/getFolderByServerRelativeUrl(@p1)/files?@p1='/sites/dev/Shared Documents/'&$select=Title&$top=3 const r = await query(); console.log(r);","title":"Example with aliasing"},{"location":"sp/alias-parameters/#example-with-aliasing-and-batching","text":"Aliasing is supported with batching as well: import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // same query with aliasing and batching const [batchedWeb, execute] = await sp.web.batched(); const query = batchedWeb.web.getFolderByServerRelativePath(\"!@p1::/sites/dev/Shared Documents/\").files.select(\"Title\").top(3); console.log(query.toUrl()); // _api/web/getFolderByServerRelativeUrl('!@p1::/sites/dev/Shared Documents/')/files console.log(query.toRequestUrl()); // _api/web/getFolderByServerRelativeUrl(@p1)/files?@p1='/sites/dev/Shared Documents/'&$select=Title&$top=3 query().then(r => { console.log(r); }); execute();","title":"Example with aliasing and batching"},{"location":"sp/alm/","text":"@pnp/sp/appcatalog \u00b6 The ALM api allows you to manage app installations both in the tenant app catalog and individual site app catalogs.

Please also see available behaviors in @pnp/core , @pnp/queryable , @pnp/graph , and @pnp/nodejs . DefaultInit \u00b6 The DefaultInit behavior, is a composed behavior which includes Telemetry, RejectOnError, and ResolveOnData. Additionally, it sets the cache and credentials properties of the RequestInit. import { spfi, DefaultInit } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(DefaultInit()); await sp.web(); DefaultHeaders \u00b6 The DefaultHeaders behavior uses InjectHeaders to set the Accept, Content-Type, and User-Agent headers. import { spfi, DefaultHeaders } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(DefaultHeaders()); await sp.web(); DefaultInit and DefaultHeaders are separated to make it easier to create your own default headers or init behavior. You should include both if composing your own default behavior. RequestDigest \u00b6 The RequestDigest behavior ensures that the \"X-RequestDigest\" header is included for requests where it is needed. If you are using MSAL, supplying your own tokens, or doing a GET request it is not required. As well it cache's the digests to reduce the number of requests. Optionally you can provide a function to supply your own digests. The logic followed by the behavior is to check the cache, run a hook if provided, and finally make a request to \"/_api/contextinfo\" for the value. import { spfi, RequestDigest } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(RequestDigest()); await sp.web(); With a hook: import { dateAdd } from \"@pnp/core\"; import { spfi, RequestDigest } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; const sp = spfi().using(RequestDigest((url, init) => { // the url will be a URL instance representing the request url // init will be the RequestInit return { expiration: dateAdd(new Date(), \"minute\", 20); value: \"MY VALID REQUEST DIGEST VALUE\"; } })); await sp.web(); SPBrowser \u00b6 A composed behavior suitable for use within a SPA or other scenario outside of SPFx. It includes DefaultHeaders, DefaultInit, BrowserFetchWithRetry, DefaultParse, and RequestDigest. As well it adds a pre observer to try and ensure the request url is absolute if one is supplied in props. The baseUrl prop can be used to configure a fallback when making urls absolute.

Sections contain columns which contain controls. There are methods to operate on these within the page, in addition to the standard array methods available in JavaScript. These samples use a variable page that is understood to be an IClientsidePage instance which is either created or loaded as outlined in previous sections. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); // add two columns with factor 6 - this is a two column layout as the total factor in a section should add up to 12 const section1 = page.addSection(); section1.addColumn(6); section1.addColumn(6); // create a three column layout in a new section const section2 = page.addSection(); section2.addColumn(4); section2.addColumn(4); section2.addColumn(4); // publish our changes await page.save(); Manipulate Sections and Columns \u00b6 import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); // drop all the columns in this section // this will also DELETE all controls contained in the columns page.sections[1].columns.length = 0; // create a new column layout page.sections[1].addColumn(4); page.sections[1].addColumn(8); // publish our changes await page.save(); Vertical Section \u00b6 The vertical section, if on the page, is stored within the sections array.

Add Text Content \u00b6 import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { ClientsideText, IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); page.addSection().addControl(new ClientsideText(\"@pnp/sp is a great library!\")); await page.save(); Add Controls \u00b6 Adding controls involves loading the available client-side part definitions from the server or creating a text part. import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages/web\"; import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { ClientsideWebpart } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // this will be a ClientsidePageComponent array // this can be cached on the client in production scenarios const partDefs = await sp.web.getClientsideWebParts(); // find the definition we want, here by id const partDef = partDefs.filter(c => c.Id === \"490d7c76-1824-45b2-9de3-676421c997fa\"); // optionally ensure you found the def if (partDef.length < 1) { // we didn't find it so we throw an error throw new Error(\"Could not find the web part\"); } // create a ClientWebPart instance from the definition const part = ClientsideWebpart.fromComponentDef(partDef[0]); // set the properties on the web part. Here for the embed web part we only have to supply an embedCode - in this case a YouTube video. // the structure of the properties varies for each web part and each version of a web part, so you will need to ensure you are setting // the properties correctly part.setProperties<{ embedCode: string }>({ embedCode: \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWQFZ7Lx-rg\", }); // we add that part to a new section page.addSection().addControl(part); await page.save(); Handle Different Webpart's Settings \u00b6 There are many ways that client side web parts are implemented and we can't provide handling within the library for all possibilities. This example shows how to handle a property set within the serverProcessedContent, in this case a List part's display title. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { ClientsideWebpart } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; // we create a class to wrap our functionality in a reusable way class ListWebpart extends ClientsideWebpart { constructor(control: ClientsideWebpart) { super((<any>control).json); } // add property getter/setter for what we need, in this case \"listTitle\" within searchablePlainTexts public get DisplayTitle(): string { return this.json.webPartData?.serverProcessedContent?.searchablePlainTexts?.listTitle || \"\"; } public set DisplayTitle(value: string) { this.json.webPartData.serverProcessedContent.searchablePlainTexts.listTitle = value; } } const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // now we load our page const page = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/SitePages/List-Web-Part.aspx\"); // get our part and pass it to the constructor of our wrapper class const part = new ListWebpart(page.sections[0].columns[0].getControl(0)); part.DisplayTitle = \"My New Title!\"; await page.save(); Unfortunately each webpart can be authored differently, so there isn't a way to know how the setting for a given webpart are stored without loading it and examining the properties. Page Operations \u00b6 There are other operation you can perform on a page in addition to manipulating the content. pageLayout \u00b6 You can get and set the page layout. Changing the layout after creating the page may have side effects and should be done cautiously. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); // get the current value const value = page.pageLayout; // set the value page.pageLayout = \"Article\"; await page.save(); bannerImageUrl \u00b6 import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); // get the current value const value = page.bannerImageUrl; // set the value page.bannerImageUrl = \"/server/relative/path/to/image.png\"; await page.save(); Banner images need to exist within the same site collection as the page where you want to use them. thumbnailUrl \u00b6 Allows you to set the thumbnail used for the page independently of the banner. If you set the bannerImageUrl property and not thumbnailUrl the thumbnail will be reset to match the banner, mimicking the UI functionality. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); // get the current value const value = page.thumbnailUrl; // set the value page.thumbnailUrl = \"/server/relative/path/to/image.png\"; await page.save(); topicHeader \u00b6 import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); // get the current value const value = page.topicHeader; // set the value page.topicHeader = \"My cool header!\"; await page.save(); // clear the topic header and hide it page.topicHeader = \"\"; await page.save(); title \u00b6 import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); // get the current value const value = page.title; // set the value page.title = \"My page title\"; await page.save(); description \u00b6 Descriptions are limited to 255 chars import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { IClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/clientside-pages\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // our page instance const page: IClientsidePage = await sp.web.loadClientsidePage(\"/sites/dev/sitepages/home.aspx\"); // get the current value const value = page.description; // set the value page.description = \"A description\"; await page.save(); layoutType \u00b6 Sets the layout type of the page.

We have added some methods to the library to help and their use is outlined below. Reading Files \u00b6 Reading files from the client using REST is covered in the below examples. The important thing to remember is choosing which format you want the file in so you can appropriately process it. You can retrieve a file as Blob, Buffer, JSON, or Text. If you have a special requirement you could also write your own parser . import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; import \"@pnp/sp/folders\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const blob: Blob = await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/documents/file.avi\").getBlob(); const buffer: ArrayBuffer = await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/documents/file.avi\").getBuffer(); const json: any = await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/documents/file.json\").getJSON(); const text: string = await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/documents/file.txt\").getText(); // all of these also work from a file object no matter how you access it const text2: string = await sp.web.getFolderByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/documents\").files.getByUrl(\"file.txt\").getText(); getFileByUrl \u00b6 This method supports opening files from sharing links or absolute urls. The file must reside in the site from which you are trying to open the file. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files/web\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const url = \"{absolute file url OR sharing url}\"; // file is an IFile and supports all the file operations const file = sp.web.getFileByUrl(url); // for example const fileContent = await file.getText(); Adding Files \u00b6 Likewise you can add files using one of two methods, addUsingPath or addChunked. AddChunked is appropriate for larger files, generally larger than 10 MB but this may differ based on your bandwidth/latency so you can adjust the code to use the chunked method. The below example shows getting the file object from an input and uploading it to SharePoint, choosing the upload method based on file size. The addUsingPath method, supports the percent or pound characters in file names. declare var require: (s: string) => any; import { ConsoleListener, Logger, LogLevel } from \"@pnp/logging\"; import { Web } from \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; import \"@pnp/sp/folders\"; import { auth } from \"./auth\"; let $ = require(\"jquery\"); // <-- used here for illustration let siteUrl = \"https://mytenant.sharepoint.com/sites/dev\"; // comment this out for non-node execution // auth(siteUrl); Logger.subscribe(new ConsoleListener()); Logger.activeLogLevel = LogLevel.Verbose; let web = Web(siteUrl); $(() => { $(\"#testingdiv\").append(\"<button id='thebuttontodoit'>Do It</button>\"); $(\"#thebuttontodoit\").on('click', async (e) => { e.preventDefault(); let input = <HTMLInputElement>document.getElementById(\"thefileinput\"); let file = input.files[0]; // you can adjust this number to control what size files are uploaded in chunks if (file.size <= 10485760) { // small upload await web.getFolderByServerRelativePath(\"Shared Documents\").files.addUsingPath(file.name, file, {Overwrite: true}); Logger.write(\"done\"); } else { // large upload await web.getFolderByServerRelativePath(\"Shared Documents\").files.addChunked(\"filename%#%.txt\", file, data => { Logger.log({ data: data, level: LogLevel.Verbose, message: \"progress\" }); }, true); Logger.write(\"done!\") } }); }); Adding a file using Nodejs Streams \u00b6 If you are working in nodejs you can also add a file using a stream. This example makes a copy of a file using streams. // triggers auto-application of extensions, in this case to add getStream import \"@pnp/nodejs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; import { createReadStream } from 'fs'; import { SPDefault } from \"@pnp/nodejs\"; import { ThrowErrors } from \"@pnp/queryable\"; // get a stream of an existing file const stream = createReadStream(\"c:/temp/file.txt\"); // now add the stream as a new file, remember to set the content-length header const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPDefault({ baseUrl: 'https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/sites/dev', msal: { config: config, scopes: [ 'https://{tenant}.sharepoint.com/.default' ] } })).using(ThrowErrors()); const fr = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"Documents\").rootFolder.files.addChunked( \"new.txt\", stream, undefined, true ); Setting Associated Item Values \u00b6 You can also update the file properties of a newly uploaded file using code similar to the below snippet: import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; import \"@pnp/sp/folders\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const file = await sp.web.getFolderByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/Shared%20Documents/test/\").files.addUsingPath(\"file.name\", \"content\", {Overwrite: true}); const item = await file.file.getItem(); await item.update({ Title: \"A Title\", OtherField: \"My Other Value\" }); Update File Content \u00b6 You can of course use similar methods to update existing files as shown below. This overwrites the existing content in the file. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; import \"@pnp/sp/folders\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/documents/test.txt\").setContent(\"New string content for the file.\"); await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/documents/test.mp4\").setContentChunked(file); Check in, Check out, and Approve & Deny \u00b6 The library provides helper methods for checking in, checking out, and approving files. Examples of these methods are shown below. Check In \u00b6 Check in takes two optional arguments, comment and check in type. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import { CheckinType } from \"@pnp/sp/files\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // default options with empty comment and CheckinType.Major await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").checkin(); console.log(\"File checked in!\"); // supply a comment (< 1024 chars) and using default check in type CheckinType.Major await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").checkin(\"A comment\"); console.log(\"File checked in!\"); // Supply both comment and check in type await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").checkin(\"A comment\", CheckinType.Overwrite); console.log(\"File checked in!\"); Check Out \u00b6 Check out takes no arguments. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").checkout(); console.log(\"File checked out!\"); Approve and Deny \u00b6 You can also approve or deny files in libraries that use approval. Approve takes a single required argument of comment, the comment is optional for deny. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").approve(\"Approval Comment\"); console.log(\"File approved!\"); // deny with no comment await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").deny(); console.log(\"File denied!\"); // deny with a supplied comment. await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").deny(\"Deny comment\"); console.log(\"File denied!\"); Publish and Unpublish \u00b6 You can both publish and unpublish a file using the library. Both methods take an optional comment argument. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/files\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // publish with no comment await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").publish(); console.log(\"File published!\"); // publish with a supplied comment. await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").publish(\"Publish comment\"); console.log(\"File published!\"); // unpublish with no comment await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").unpublish(); console.log(\"File unpublished!\"); // unpublish with a supplied comment. await sp.web.getFileByServerRelativePath(\"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\").unpublish(\"Unpublish comment\"); console.log(\"File unpublished!\"); Advanced Upload Options \u00b6 Both the addChunked and setContentChunked methods support options beyond just supplying the file content. progress function \u00b6 A method that is called each time a chunk is uploaded and provides enough information to report progress or update a progress bar easily. The method has the signature: (data: ChunkedFileUploadProgressData) => void The data interface is: export interface ChunkedFileUploadProgressData { stage: \"starting\" | \"continue\" | \"finishing\"; blockNumber: number; totalBlocks: number; chunkSize: number; currentPointer: number; fileSize: number; } chunkSize \u00b6 This property controls the size of the individual chunks and is defaulted to 10485760 bytes (10 MB). You can adjust this based on your bandwidth needs - especially if writing code for mobile uploads or you are seeing frequent timeouts. getItem \u00b6 This method allows you to get the item associated with this file. You can optionally specify one or more select fields.

To simplify things you can use the getPaged method on the Items class to assist. Note that there isn't a way to move backwards in the collection, this is by design. The pattern you should use to support backwards navigation in the results is to cache the results into a local array and use the standard array operators to get previous pages. Alternatively you can append the results to the UI, but this can have performance impact for large result sets. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // basic case to get paged items form a list const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"BigList\").items.getPaged(); // you can also provide a type for the returned values instead of any const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"BigList\").items.getPaged<{Title: string}[]>(); // the query also works with select to choose certain fields and top to set the page size const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"BigList\").items.select(\"Title\", \"Description\").top(50).getPaged<{Title: string}[]>(); // the results object will have two properties and one method: // the results property will be an array of the items returned if (items.results.length > 0) { console.log(\"We got results!\"); for (let i = 0; i < items.results.length; i++) { // type checking works here if we specify the return type console.log(items.results[i].Title); } } // the hasNext property is used with the getNext method to handle paging // hasNext will be true so long as there are additional results if (items.hasNext) { // this will carry over the type specified in the original query for the results array items = await items.getNext(); console.log(items.results.length); } getListItemChangesSinceToken \u00b6 The GetListItemChangesSinceToken method allows clients to track changes on a list. Changes, including deleted items, are returned along with a token that represents the moment in time when those changes were requested. By including this token when you call GetListItemChangesSinceToken, the server looks for only those changes that have occurred since the token was generated. Sending a GetListItemChangesSinceToken request without including a token returns the list schema, the full list contents and a token. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // Using RowLimit.

Using null with ChangeToken gets everything const changes = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"BigList\").getListItemChangesSinceToken({ChangeToken: null}); Get All Items \u00b6 Using the items collection's getAll method you can get all of the items in a list regardless of the size of the list. Sample usage is shown below. Only the odata operations top, select, and filter are supported. usingCaching and inBatch are ignored - you will need to handle caching the results on your own. This method will write a warning to the Logger and should not frequently be used. Instead the standard paging operations should be used. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // basic usage const allItems: any[] = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"BigList\").items.getAll(); console.log(allItems.length); // set page size const allItems: any[] = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"BigList\").items.getAll(4000); console.log(allItems.length); // use select and top. top will set page size and override the any value passed to getAll const allItems: any[] = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"BigList\").items.select(\"Title\").top(4000).getAll(); console.log(allItems.length); // we can also use filter as a supported odata operation, but this will likely fail on large lists const allItems: any[] = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"BigList\").items.select(\"Title\").filter(\"Title eq 'Test'\").getAll(); console.log(allItems.length); Retrieving Lookup Fields \u00b6 When working with lookup fields you need to use the expand operator along with select to get the related fields from the lookup column. This works for both the items collection and item instances. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const items = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"LookupList\").items.select(\"Title\", \"Lookup/Title\", \"Lookup/ID\").expand(\"Lookup\")(); console.log(items); const item = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"LookupList\").items.getById(1).select(\"Title\", \"Lookup/Title\", \"Lookup/ID\").expand(\"Lookup\")(); console.log(item); Filter using Metadata fields \u00b6 To filter on a metadata field you must use the getItemsByCAMLQuery method as $filter does not support these fields. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists/web\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const r = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"TaxonomyList\").getItemsByCAMLQuery({ ViewXml: `<View><Query><Where><Eq><FieldRef Name=\"MetaData\"/><Value Type=\"TaxonomyFieldType\">Term 2</Value></Eq></Where></Query></View>`, }); Retrieving PublishingPageImage \u00b6 The PublishingPageImage and some other publishing-related fields aren't stored in normal fields, rather in the MetaInfo field. To get these values you need to use the technique shown below, and originally outlined in this thread . Note that a lot of information can be stored in this field so will pull back potentially a significant amount of data, so limit the rows as possible to aid performance. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; import { Web } from \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; try { const sp = spfi(\"https://{publishing site url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const r = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"Pages\").items .select(\"Title\", \"FileRef\", \"FieldValuesAsText/MetaInfo\") .expand(\"FieldValuesAsText\") (); // look through the returned items. for (var i = 0; i < r.length; i++) { // the title field value console.log(r[i].Title); // find the value in the MetaInfo string using regex const matches = /PublishingPageImage:SW\\|(.*?)\\r\\n/ig.exec(r[i].FieldValuesAsText.MetaInfo); if (matches !== null && matches.length > 1) { // this wil be the value of the PublishingPageImage field console.log(matches[1]); } } } catch (e) { console.error(e); } Add Items \u00b6 There are several ways to add items to a list. The simplest just uses the add method of the items collection passing in the properties as a plain object. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; import { IItemAddResult } from \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // add an item to the list const iar: IItemAddResult = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"My List\").items.add({ Title: \"Title\", Description: \"Description\" }); console.log(iar); Content Type \u00b6 You can also set the content type id when you create an item as shown in the example below. For more information on content type IDs reference the Microsoft Documentation . While this documentation references SharePoint 2010 the structure of the IDs has not changed. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); await sp.web.lists.getById(\"4D5A36EA-6E84-4160-8458-65C436DB765C\").items.add({ Title: \"Test 1\", ContentTypeId: \"0x01030058FD86C279252341AB303852303E4DAF\" }); User Fields \u00b6 There are two types of user fields, those that allow a single value and those that allow multiple. For both types, you first need to determine the Id field name, which you can do by doing a GET REST request on an existing item. Typically the value will be the user field internal name with \"Id\" appended. So in our example, we have two fields User1 and User2 so the Id fields are User1Id and User2Id. Next, you need to remember there are two types of user fields, those that take a single value and those that allow multiple - these are updated in different ways. For single value user fields you supply just the user's id. For multiple value fields, you need to supply an object with a \"results\" property and an array. Examples for both are shown below. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; import { getGUID } from \"@pnp/core\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const i = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"PeopleFields\").items.add({ Title: getGUID(), User1Id: 9, // allows a single user User2Id: { results: [16, 45] // allows multiple users } }); console.log(i); If you want to update or add user field values when using validateUpdateListItem you need to use the form shown below. You can specify multiple values in the array. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const result = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"UserFieldList\").items.getById(1).validateUpdateListItem([{ FieldName: \"UserField\", FieldValue: JSON.stringify([{ \"Key\": \"i:0#.f|membership|person@tenant.com\" }]), }, { FieldName: \"Title\", FieldValue: \"Test - Updated\", }]); Lookup Fields \u00b6 What is said for User Fields is, in general, relevant to Lookup Fields: Lookup Field types: Single-valued lookup Multiple-valued lookup Id suffix should be appended to the end of lookups EntityPropertyName in payloads Numeric Ids for lookups' items should be passed as values import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; import { getGUID } from \"@pnp/core\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"LookupFields\").items.add({ Title: getGUID(), LookupFieldId: 2, // allows a single lookup value MultiLookupFieldId: { results: [ 1, 56 ] // allows multiple lookup value } }); Add Multiple Items \u00b6 import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"rapidadd\"); const entityTypeFullName = await list.getListItemEntityTypeFullName() const batch = sp.web.createBatch(); list.items.inBatch(batch).add({ Title: \"Batch 6\" }, entityTypeFullName).then(b => { console.log(b); }); list.items.inBatch(batch).add({ Title: \"Batch 7\" }, entityTypeFullName).then(b => { console.log(b); }); await batch.execute(); console.log(\"Done\"); Update \u00b6 The update method is very similar to the add method in that it takes a plain object representing the fields to update. The property names are the internal names of the fields. If you aren't sure you can always do a get request for an item in the list and see the field names that come back - you would use these same names to update the item. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"MyList\"); const i = await list.items.getById(1).update({ Title: \"My New Title\", Description: \"Here is a new description\" }); console.log(i); Getting and updating a collection using filter \u00b6 import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // you are getting back a collection here const items: any[] = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"MyList\").items.top(1).filter(\"Title eq 'A Title'\")(); // see if we got something if (items.length > 0) { const updatedItem = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"MyList\").items.getById(items[0].Id).update({ Title: \"Updated Title\", }); console.log(JSON.stringify(updatedItem)); } Update Multiple Items \u00b6 This approach avoids multiple calls for the same list's entity type name. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"rapidupdate\"); const entityTypeFullName = await list.getListItemEntityTypeFullName() const batch = sp.web.createBatch(); // note requirement of \"*\" eTag param - or use a specific eTag value as needed list.items.getById(1).inBatch(batch).update({ Title: \"Batch 6\" }, \"*\", entityTypeFullName).then(b => { console.log(b); }); list.items.getById(2).inBatch(batch).update({ Title: \"Batch 7\" }, \"*\", entityTypeFullName).then(b => { console.log(b); }); await batch.execute(); console.log(\"Done\") Update Multi-value Taxonomy field \u00b6 Based on this excellent article from Beau Cameron. As he says you must update a hidden field to get this to work via REST. My meta data field accepting multiple values is called \"MultiMetaData\". import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; import \"@pnp/sp/fields\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // first we need to get the hidden field's internal name. // The Title of that hidden field is, in my case and in the linked article just the visible field name with \"_0\" appended. const fields = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"TestList\").fields.filter(\"Title eq 'MultiMetaData_0'\").select(\"Title\", \"InternalName\")(); // get an item to update, here we just create one for testing const newItem = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"TestList\").items.add({ Title: \"Testing\", }); // now we have to create an update object // to do that for each field value you need to serialize each as -1;#{field label}|{field id} joined by \";#\" // update with the values you want, this also works in the add call directly to avoid a second call const updateVal = {}; Reflect.defineProperty(updateVal, fields[0].InternalName, { value: \"-1;#New Term|bb046161-49cc-41bd-a459-5667175920d4;#-1;#New 2|0069972e-67f1-4c5e-99b6-24ac5c90b7c9\" }); // execute the update call await newItem.item.update(updateVal); Recycle \u00b6 To send an item to the recycle bin use recycle. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"MyList\"); const recycleBinIdentifier = await list.items.getById(1).recycle(); Delete \u00b6 Delete is as simple as calling the .delete method. It optionally takes an eTag if you need to manage concurrency. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"MyList\"); await list.items.getById(1).delete(); Delete With Params \u00b6 Deletes the item object with options. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const list = sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"MyList\"); await list.items.getById(1).deleteWithParams({ BypassSharedLock: true, }); The deleteWithParams method can only be used by accounts where UserToken.IsSystemAccount is true Resolving field names \u00b6 It's a very common mistake trying wrong field names in the requests. Field's EntityPropertyName value should be used. The easiest way to get know EntityPropertyName is to use the following snippet: import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/lists\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; import \"@pnp/sp/fields\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const response = await sp.web.lists .getByTitle('[Lists_Title]') .fields .select('Title, EntityPropertyName') .filter(`Hidden eq false and Title eq '[Field's_Display_Name]'`) (); console.log(response.map(field => { return { Title: field.Title, EntityPropertyName: field.EntityPropertyName }; })); Lookup fields' names should be ended with additional Id suffix. E.g. for Editor EntityPropertyName EditorId should be used. getParentInfos \u00b6 Gets information about an item, including details about the parent list, parent list root folder, and parent web. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/webs\"; import \"@pnp/sp/items\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); const item: any = await sp.web.lists.getByTitle(\"My List\").items.getById(1)(); await item.getParentInfos();","title":"List Items"},{"location":"sp/items/#pnpspitems","text":"","title":"@pnp/sp/items"},{"location":"sp/items/#get","text":"Getting items from a list is one of the basic actions that most applications require.

These examples all use the Web to get the values, however the methods work identically on all securables.

The library provides support for searching and suggest - as well as some interfaces and helper classes to make building your queries and processing responses easier. Search \u00b6 Search is accessed directly from the root sp object and can take either a string representing the query text, a plain object matching the ISearchQuery interface, or a SearchQueryBuilder instance. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/search\"; import { ISearchQuery, SearchResults, SearchQueryBuilder } from \"@pnp/sp/search\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // text search using SharePoint default values for other parameters const results: SearchResults = await sp.search(\"test\"); console.log(results.ElapsedTime); console.log(results.RowCount); console.log(results.PrimarySearchResults); // define a search query object matching the ISearchQuery interface const results2: SearchResults = await sp.search(<ISearchQuery>{ Querytext: \"test\", RowLimit: 10, EnableInterleaving: true, }); console.log(results2.ElapsedTime); console.log(results2.RowCount); console.log(results2.PrimarySearchResults); // define a query using a builder const builder = SearchQueryBuilder(\"test\").rowLimit(10).enableInterleaving.enableQueryRules.processPersonalFavorites; const results3 = await sp.search(builder); console.log(results3.ElapsedTime); console.log(results3.RowCount); console.log(results3.PrimarySearchResults); Search Result Caching \u00b6 You can use the searchWithCaching method to enable cache support for your search results this option works with any of the options for providing a query, just replace \"search\" with \"searchWithCaching\" in your method chain and gain all the benefits of caching. The second parameter is optional and allows you to specify the cache options import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/search\"; import { ISearchQuery, SearchResults, SearchQueryBuilder } from \"@pnp/sp/search\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); sp.searchWithCaching({ Querytext: \"test\", RowLimit: 10, EnableInterleaving: true, } as ISearchQuery).then((r: SearchResults) => { console.log(r.ElapsedTime); console.log(r.RowCount); console.log(r.PrimarySearchResults); }); // use a query builder const builder = SearchQueryBuilder(\"test\").rowLimit(3); // supply a search query builder and caching options const results2 = await sp.searchWithCaching(builder, { key: \"mykey\", expiration: dateAdd(new Date(), \"month\", 1) }); console.log(results2.TotalRows); Paging with SearchResults.getPage \u00b6 Paging is controlled by a start row and page size parameter. You can specify both arguments in your initial query however you can use the getPage method to jump to any page. The second parameter page size is optional and will use the previous RowLimit or default to 10. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/search\"; import { SearchResults, SearchQueryBuilder } from \"@pnp/sp/search\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // this will hold our current results let currentResults: SearchResults = null; let page = 1; // triggered on page load or through some other means function onStart() { // construct our query that will be used throughout the paging process, likely from user input const q = SearchQueryBuilder(\"test\").rowLimit(5); const results = await sp.search(q); currentResults = results; // set the current results page = 1; // reset page counter // update UI... } // triggered by an event async function next() { currentResults = await currentResults.getPage(++page); // update UI... } // triggered by an event async function prev() { currentResults = await currentResults.getPage(--page); // update UI... } SearchQueryBuilder \u00b6 The SearchQueryBuilder allows you to build your queries in a fluent manner. It also accepts constructor arguments for query text and a base query plain object, should you have a shared configuration for queries in an application you can define them once. The methods and properties match those on the SearchQuery interface. Boolean properties add the flag to the query while methods require that you supply one or more arguments. Also arguments supplied later in the chain will overwrite previous values. import { spfi, SPFx } from \"@pnp/sp\"; import \"@pnp/sp/search\"; import { SearchQueryBuilder, SearchResults, ISearchQuery } from \"@pnp/sp/search\"; const sp = spfi(\"{tenant url}\").using(SPFx(this.context)); // basic usage let q = SearchQueryBuilder().text(\"test\").rowLimit(4).enablePhonetic; sp.search(q).then(h => { /* ... */ }); // provide a default query text at creation let q2 = SearchQueryBuilder(\"text\").rowLimit(4).enablePhonetic; const results: SearchResults = await sp.search(q2); // provide query text and a template for // shared settings across queries that can // be overwritten by individual builders const appSearchSettings: ISearchQuery = { EnablePhonetic: true, HiddenConstraints: \"reports\" }; let q3 = SearchQueryBuilder(\"test\", appSearchSettings).enableQueryRules; let q4 = SearchQueryBuilder(\"financial data\", appSearchSettings).enableSorting.enableStemming; const results2 = await sp.search(q3); const results3 = sp.search(q4); Search Suggest \u00b6 Search suggest works in much the same way as search, except against the suggest end point.
