This uses the launch.json file to build and run the library using ./debug/launch/main.ts as the program entry. You can add any number of files to this directory and they will be ignored by git, however the debug.ts file is not, so please ensure you don't commit any login information. Setup \u00b6 Creating settings.js \u00b6 If you have not already you need to create a settings.js files by copying settings.example.js and renaming it to settings.js. The first section spsave should be configured with a username, password, and site collection url. The user provided should be a site collection admin of the site collection you specify. The testing.sp section will be updated with information from the Register an Add-in The testing.graph section will be updated with information from the Create App Registration for Graph Testing Register an Add-in \u00b6 Before you can begin debugging you need to register a low-trust add-in with SharePoint. This is primarily designed for Office 365, but can work on-premises if you configure your farm accordingly . Navigation to https://{tenant}/{site}/_layouts/appregnew.aspx Click \"Generate\" for both the Client Id and Secret values Give you add-in a title, this can be anything but will let you locate it in the list of add-in permissions Provide a fake value for app domain and redirect uri, you can use the values shown in the examples Click Create Copy the returned block of text containing the client id and secret as well as app name for your records and later in this article. Grant Your Add-In Permissions \u00b6 Now that we have created an add-in registration we need to tell SharePoint what permissions it can use. Due to an update in SharePoint Online you now have to register add-ins with certain permissions in the admin site . Navigate to https://{tenant}-admin/_layouts/appinv.aspx Paste your Client Id from the above section into the Add Id box and click \"Lookup\" You should see the information populated into the form from the last section, if not ensure you have the correct id value Paste the below XML into the permissions request xml box and hit \"Create\" You should get a confirmation message. <AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy= \"true\" > <AppPermissionRequest Scope= \"http://sharepoint/content/tenant\" Right= \"FullControl\" /> <AppPermissionRequest Scope= \"http://sharepoint/social/tenant\" Right= \"FullControl\" /> <AppPermissionRequest Scope= \"http://sharepoint/search\" Right= \"QueryAsUserIgnoreAppPrincipal\" /> </AppPermissionRequests> Note these are very broad permissions to ensure you can test any feature of the library, for production you should tailor the permissions to only those required Configure the project settings file (settings.js) \u00b6 If you have not already, make a copy of settings.example.js and name it settings.js Edit this file to set the values on the testing.sp object to id: \"The client id you created\" secret: \"The client secret you created\" url: https://{tenant}/{site} (same url used in spsave section) notificationUrl: https://{tenant}/{site} (same url used in spsave section) You can disable web tests at any time by setting enableWebTests to false in settings.js, this can be helpful as they take a few minutes to run Create App Registration for Graph Testing \u00b6 Test your setup \u00b6 If you hit F5 now you should be able to see the full response from getting the web's title in the internal console window. If not, ensure that you have properly updated the settings file and registered the add-in perms correctly. How to create a debug module \u00b6 Using ./debug/launch/example.ts as a reference create a debugging file in the debug folder, let's call it mydebug.ts and add this content: // note we can use the actual package names for our imports import { sp , ListEnsureResult } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import { Logger , LogLevel , ConsoleListener } from \"@pnp/logging\" ; declare var process : { exit ( code? : number ) : void }; export function MyDebug() { // run some debugging sp . web . lists . ensure ( \"MyFirstList\" ). then (( list : ListEnsureResult ) => { Logger . log ({ data : list.created , message : \"Was list created?\" , level : LogLevel.Verbose }); if ( list . created ) { Logger . log ({ data : list.data , message : \"Raw data from list creation.\" , level : LogLevel.Verbose }); } else { Logger . log ({ data : null , message : \"List already existed!\" , level : LogLevel.Verbose }); } process . exit ( 0 ); }). catch ( e => { Logger . error ( e ); process . exit ( 1 ); }); } Update main.ts to launch your module \u00b6 First comment out the import for the default example and then add the import and function call for yours, the updated main.ts should look like this: // ... // comment out the example // import { Example } from \"./example\"; // Example(); import { MyDebug } from \"./mydebug\" MyDebug (); // ... Debug \u00b6 Place a break point within the promise resolution in your debug file and hit F5. Your module should be run and your break point hit. You can then examine the contents of the objects and see the run time state. Remember you can also set breakpoints within the package src folders to see exactly how things are working during your debugging scenarios. Debug Module Next Steps \u00b6 Using this pattern you can create and preserve multiple debugging scenarios in separate modules locally. In Browser Debugging \u00b6 You can also serve files locally to debug in a browser through two methods. The first will serve code using ./debug/serve/main.ts as the entry. Meaning you can easily write code and test it in the browser. The second method allows you to serve a single package (bundled with all dependencies) for in browser testing. Both methods serve the file from https://localhost:8080/assets/pnp.js, allowing you to create a single page in your tenant for in browser testing. Start the local serve \u00b6 This will serve a package with ./debug/serve/main.ts as the entry. gulp serve Add reference to library \u00b6 Within a SharePoint page add a script editor web part and then paste in the following code. The div is to give you a place to target with visual updates should you desire. < script src = \"https://localhost:8080/assets/pnp.js\" ></ script > < div id = \"pnptestdiv\" ></ div > You should see an alert with the current web's title using the default main.ts. Feel free to update main.ts to do whatever you would like, but note that any changes included as part of a PR to this file will not be allowed. Serve a specific package \u00b6 For example if you wanted to serve the @pnp/sp package for testing you would use: gulp serve --p sp This will serve a bundle of the sp functionality along with all dependencies and place a global variable named \"pnp.{packagename}\", in this case pnp.sp. This will be true for each package, if you served just the graph package the global would be pnp.graph. This mirrors how the umd modules are built in the distributed npm packages to allow testing with matching packages. Next Steps \u00b6 You can make changes to the library and immediately see them reflected in the browser. All files are watched regardless of which serve method you choose.","title":"Debugging"},{"location":"debugging/#debugging","text":"","title":"Debugging"},{"location":"debugging/#debugging-library-features-in-code-using-node","text":"The easiest way to debug the library when working on new features is using F5 in Visual Studio Code.

To get started you need to install the libraries you need via npm. Many of the packages have a peer dependency to other packages with the @pnp namespace meaning you may need to install more than one package. All packages are released together eliminating version confusion - all packages will depend on packages with the same version number. If you need to support older browsers please review the article on polyfills for required functionality. Install \u00b6 First you will need to install those libraries you want to use in your application. Here we will install the most frequently used packages. This step applies to any environment or project. npm install @pnp/sp @pnp/graph --save Next we can import and use the functionality within our application. The below is a very simple example, please see the individual package documentation for more details. import { getRandomString } from \"@pnp/common\" ; ( function () { // get and log a random string console . log ( getRandomString ( 20 )); })() Getting Started with SharePoint Framework \u00b6 The @pnp/sp and @pnp/graph libraries are designed to work seamlessly within SharePoint Framework projects with a small amount of upfront configuration. If you are running in 2016 on-premesis please read this note on a workaround for the included TypeScript version. If you are targetting SharePoint online you do not need to take any additional steps. Establish Context \u00b6 Because SharePoint Framework provides a local context to each component we need to set that context within the library. This allows us to determine request urls as well as use the SPFx HttpGraphClient within @pnp/graph. There are two ways to provide the spfx context to the library. Either through the setup method imported from @pnp/common or using the setup method on either the @pnp/sp or @pnp/graph main export. All three are shown below and are equivalent, meaning if you are already importing the sp variable from @pnp/sp or the graph variable from @pnp/graph you should use their setup method to reduce imports. The setup is always done in the onInit method to ensure it runs before your other lifecycle code. You can also set any other settings at this time. Using @pnp/common setup \u00b6 import { setup as pnpSetup } from \"@pnp/common\" ; // ... public onInit () : Promise < void > { return super . onInit (). then ( _ => { // other init code may be present pnpSetup ({ spfxContext : this.context }); }); } // ...

The below guide we have provided an overview of what it takes to transition between the libraries. If we missed something, please let us know in the issues list so we can update the guide. Thanks! Installing @pnp libraries \u00b6 In version 1.* the libraries were setup as peer dependencies of each other requiring you to install each of them seperately. We continue to believe this correctly describes the relationship, but recognize that basically nothing in the world accounts for peer dependencies. So we have upated the libraries to be dependencies. This makes it easier to install into your projects as you only need to install a single library: npm i --save @pnp/sp Selective Imports \u00b6 Another big change in v2 is the ability to selectively import the pieces you need from the libraries. This allows you to have smaller bundles and works well with tree-shaking. It does require you to have more import statements, which can potentially be a bit confusing at first. The selective imports apply to the sp and graph libraries. To help explain let's take the example of the Web object. In v1 Web includes a reference to pretty much everything else in the entire sp library. Meaning that if you use web (and you pretty much have to) you hold a ref to all the other pieces (like Fields, Lists, ContentTypes) even if you aren't using them. Because of that tree shaking can't do anything to reduce the bundle size because it \"thinks\" you are using them simply because they have been imported. To solve this in v2 the Web object no longer contains references to anything, it is a bare object with a few methods. If you look at the source you will see that, for example, there is no longer a \"lists\" property. These properties and methods are now added through selectively importing the functionality you need: Selectively Import Web lists functionality \u00b6 import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; // this imports the functionality for lists associated only with web import \"@pnp/sp/src/lists/web\" ; const r = await sp . web . lists (); import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; // this imports all the functionality for lists import \"@pnp/sp/src/lists\" ; const r = await sp . web . lists (); Each of the docs pages shows the selective import paths for each sub-module (lists, items, etc.). Presets \u00b6 In addition to the ability to selectively import functionality you can import presets. This allows you to import an entire set of functionality in a single line. At launch the sp library will support two presets \"all\" and \"core\" with the graph library supporting \"all\". Using the \"all\" preset will match the functionality of v1. This can save you time in transitioning your projects so you can update to selective imports later. For new projects we recommend using the selective imports from day 1. To update your V1 projects to V2 you can replace all instances of \"@pnp/sp\" with \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\" and things should work as before (though some class names or other things may have changed, please review the change log and the rest of this guide). // V1 way of doing things: import { sp , ClientSideWebpart , ClientSideWebpartPropertyTypes , } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // V2 way with selective imports import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import { ClientSideWebpart , ClientSideWebpartPropertyTypes } from \"@pnp/sp/src/clientside-pages\" ; // V2 way with preset \"all\" import { sp , ClientSideWebpart , ClientSideWebpartPropertyTypes } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\" ; Invokable Objects \u00b6 Another new feature is the addition of invokable objects. Previously where you used \"get()\" to invoke a request you can now leave it off. We have left the .get method in place so everyone's code wasn't broken immediately upon transitioning. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; // old way (still works) const r1 = sp . web . get (); // invokable const r2 = sp . web (); The benefit is that objects can now support default actions that are not \"get\" but might be \"post\". And you save typing a few extra characters. This still work the same as with select or any of the other odata methods: import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; // invokable const r = sp . web . select ( \"Title\" , \"Url\" )(); Factory Functions & Interfaces \u00b6 Another change in the library is in the strcture of exports. We are no longer exporting the objects themselves, rather we are only exposing factory functions and interfaces. This allows us to decouple what developers use from our internal implementation. For folks using the fluent chain starting with sp you shouldn't need to update your code. If you are using any of the v1 classes directly you should just need to remove the \"new\" keyword and update the import path. The factory functions signature matches the contructor signature of the v1 objects. // v1 import { Web } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; const web : Web = new Web ( \"some absolute url\" ); const r1 = web . get (); // v2 import { Web , IWeb } from \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; const web : IWeb = Web ( \"some absolute url\" ); const r2 = web (); Entension Methods \u00b6 Another new capability in v2 is the ability to extend objects and factories. This allows you to easily add methods or properties on a per-object basis. Please see the full article on extension methods describing this great new capability. CDN publishing \u00b6 Starting with v2 we will no longer create bundles for each of the packages. Historically these are not commonly used, don't work perfectly for everyone (there are a lot fo ways to bundle things), and another piece we need to maintain. Instead we encourage folks to create their own bundles , optimized for their particular scenario. This will result in smaller overall bundle size and allow folks to bundle things to match their scenario. Please review the article on creating your custom bundles to see how to tailor bundles to your needs. Inline with this we will drop the pnpjs library for the same reason. Drop client-svc and sp-taxonomy libraries \u00b6 These libraries were created to allow folks to access and manage SharePoint taxonomy and manage metadata. Given that there is upcoming support for taxonomy via a supported REST API we will drop these two libraries. If working with taxonomy remains a core requirement of your application and we do not yet have support for the new apis, please remain on v1 for the time being.

You can also read more about how this process works and the necessary SPFx configurations in the SharePoint Framework 1.6 release notes . This method only work for SharePoint Framework >= 1.6. For earlier versions of SharePoint Framework you can still use the AdalClient as outlined above using the constructor to specify the values for an AAD Application you have setup. Calling the graph api \u00b6 By providing the context in the onInit we can create the adal client from known information. import { graph } from \"@pnp/graph\" ; import { getRandomString } from \"@pnp/common\" ; // ... public onInit () : Promise < void > { return super . onInit (). then ( _ => { // other init code may be present graph . setup ({ spfxContext : this.context }); }); } public render () : void { // here we are creating a team with a random name, required Group ReadWrite All permissions const teamName = `ATeam. ${ getRandomString ( 4 ) } ` ; this . domElement . innerHTML = `Hello, I am creating a team named \" ${ teamName } \" for you...` ; graph . teams . create ( teamName , \"This is a description\" ). then ( t => { this . domElement . innerHTML += \"done!\" ; }). catch ( e => { this . domElement . innerHTML = `Oops, I ran into a problem... ${ JSON . stringify ( e , null , 4 ) } ` ; }); } Calling the SharePoint API \u00b6 This example shows how to use the ADALClient with the @pnp/sp library to call import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\" ; import { AdalClient } from \"@pnp/adaljsclient\" ; // ... public onInit () : Promise < void > { return super . onInit (). then ( _ => { // other init code may be present sp . setup ({ spfxContext : this.context , sp : { fetchClientFactory : () => , }, }); }); } public render () : void { sp . web . get (). then ( t => { this . domElement . innerHTML = JSON . stringify ( t ); }). catch ( e => { this . domElement . innerHTML = JSON . stringify ( e ); }); } Calling the any API \u00b6 You can also use the AdalClient to execute AAD authenticated requests to any API which is properly configured to accept the incoming tokens. This approach will only work within SharePoint Framework >= 1.6. Here we call the SharePoint REST API without the sp library as an example. import { FetchOptions } from \"@pnp/common\" ; import { AdalClient } from \"@pnp/adaljsclient\" ; import { ODataDefaultParser } from \"@pnp/odata\" ; // ... public render () : void { // create an ADAL Client const client = AdalClient . fromSPFxContext ( this . context ); // setup the request options const opts : FetchOptions = { method : \"GET\" , headers : { \"Accept\" : \"application/json\" , }, }; // execute the request client . fetch ( \"https://318studios.sharepoint.com/_api/web\" , opts ). then ( response => { // create a parser to convert the response into JSON. // You can create your own, at this point you have a fetch Response to work with const parser = new ODataDefaultParser (); parser . parse ( response ). then ( json => { this . domElement . innerHTML = JSON . stringify ( json ); }); }). catch ( e => { this . domElement . innerHTML = JSON . stringify ( e ); }); } Manually Configure \u00b6 This example shows setting up and using the AdalClient to make queries using information you have setup.

This can be accomplished in two ways. The first is to explicitly call the new deleteExpired method on the cache you wish to clear. A suggested usage is to add this into your page init code as clearing expired items once per page load is likely sufficient. import { PnPClientStorage } from \"@pnp/common\" ; const storage = new PnPClientStorage (); // session storage storage . session . deleteExpired (); // local storage storage . local . deleteExpired (); // this returns a promise, so you can perform some activity after the expired items are removed: storage . local . deleteExpired (). then ( _ => { // init my application }); The second method is to enable automated cache expiration through global config. Setting the enableCacheExpiration property to true will enable the timer. Optionally you can set the interval at which the cache is checked via the cacheExpirationIntervalMilliseconds property, by default 750 milliseconds is used. We enforce a minimum of 300 milliseconds as this functionality is enabled via setTimeout and there is little value in having an excessive number of cache checks. This method is more appropriate for a single page application where the page is infrequently reloaded and many cached operations are performed. There is no advantage to enabling cache expiration unless you are experiencing cache storage space pressure in a long running page - and you may see a performance hit due to the use of setTimeout. import { setup } from \"@pnp/common\" ; setup ({ enableCacheExpiration : true , cacheExpirationIntervalMilliseconds : 1000 , // optional });","title":"storage"},{"location":"common/storage/#pnpcommonstorage","text":"This module provides a thin wrapper over the browser storage options, local and session.

Download the fetch polyfill from https://github.com/github/fetch and upload it to your style library. Download the corejs polyfill from https://github.com/zloirock/core-js and upload it to your style library. Update your module loader to set these files as dependencies before the pnp library is opened.

This article outlines how to setup logging and use the various loggers. Getting Started \u00b6 Install the logging module, it has no other dependencies npm install @pnp/logging --save Understanding the Logging Framework \u00b6 The logging framework is centered on the Logger class to which any number of listeners can be subscribed. Each of these listeners will receive each of the messages logged. Each listener must implement the LogListener interface, shown below. There is only one method to implement and it takes an instance of the LogEntry interface as a parameter. /** * Interface that defines a log listner * */ export interface LogListener { /** * Any associated data that a given logging listener may choose to log or ignore * * @param entry The information to be logged */ log ( entry : LogEntry ) : void ; } /** * Interface that defines a log entry * */ export interface LogEntry { /** * The main message to be logged */ message : string ; /** * The level of information this message represents */ level : LogLevel ; /** * Any associated data that a given logging listener may choose to log or ignore */ data? : any ; } Log Levels \u00b6 export const enum LogLevel { Verbose = 0 , Info = 1 , Warning = 2 , Error = 3 , Off = 99 , } Writing to the Logger \u00b6 To write information to a logger you can use either write, writeJSON, or log. import { Logger , LogLevel } from \"@pnp/logging\" ; // write logs a simple string as the message value of the LogEntry Logger . write ( \"This is logging a simple string\" ); // optionally passing a level, default level is Verbose Logger . write ( \"This is logging a simple string\" , LogLevel . Error ); // this will convert the object to a string using JSON.stringify and set the message with the result Logger . writeJSON ({ name : \"value\" , name2 : \"value2\" }); // optionally passing a level, default level is Verbose Logger . writeJSON ({ name : \"value\" , name2 : \"value2\" }, LogLevel . Warn ); // specify the entire LogEntry interface using log Logger . log ({ data : { name : \"value\" , name2 : \"value2\" }, level : LogLevel.Warning , message : \"This is my message\" }); Log an error \u00b6 There exists a shortcut method to log an error to the Logger. This will log an entry to the subscribed loggers where the data property will be the Error instance pased in, the level will be 'Error', and the message will be the Error instance's message property. const e = Error ( \"An Error\" ); Logger . error ( e ); Subscribing a Listener \u00b6 By default no listeners are subscribed, so if you would like to get logging information you need to subscribe at least one listener. This is done as shown below by importing the Logger and your listener(s) of choice. Here we are using the provided ConsoleListener. We are also setting the active log level, which controls the level of logging that will be output. Be aware that Verbose produces a substantial amount of data about each request. import { Logger , ConsoleListener , LogLevel } from \"@pnp/logging\" ; // subscribe a listener Logger . subscribe ( new ConsoleListener ()); // set the active log level Logger . activeLogLevel = LogLevel . Info ; Available Listeners \u00b6 There are two listeners included in the library, ConsoleListener and FunctionListener. ConsoleListener \u00b6 This listener outputs information to the console and works in Node as well as within browsers. It takes no settings and writes to the appropriate console method based on message level. For example a LogEntry with level Warning will be written to console.warn. Usage is shown in the example above. FunctionListener \u00b6 The FunctionListener allows you to wrap any functionality by creating a function that takes a LogEntry as its single argument. This produces the same result as implementing the LogListener interface, but is useful if you already have a logging method or framework to which you want to pass the messages. import { Logger , FunctionListener , LogEntry } from \"@pnp/logging\" ; let listener = new FunctionListener (( entry : LogEntry ) => { // pass all logging data to an existing framework MyExistingCompanyLoggingFramework . log ( entry . message ); }); Logger . subscribe ( listener ); Create a Custom Listener \u00b6 If desirable for your project you can create a custom listener to perform any logging action you would like. This is done by implementing the LogListener interface. import { Logger , LogListener , LogEntry } from \"@pnp/logging\" ; class MyListener implements LogListener { log ( entry : LogEntry ) : void { // here you would do something with the entry } } Logger . subscribe ( new MyListener ());","title":"logging"},{"location":"logging/#pnplogging","text":"The logging module provides light weight subscribable and extensiable logging framework which is used internally and available for use in your projects.

You can determine the correct value for the realm by navigating to \"https://{site name}-admin.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/TA_AllAppPrincipals.aspx\" and copying the GUID value that appears after the \"@\" - this is the realm id. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\" ; import { SPFetchClient , SPOAuthEnv } from \"@pnp/nodejs\" ; sp . setup ({ sp : { fetchClientFactory : () => { return new SPFetchClient ( \"{site url}\" , \"{client id}\" , \"{client secret}\" , SPOAuthEnv .

Register An Add-In \u00b6 Before you can begin running tests you need to register a low-trust add-in with SharePoint. This is primarily designed for Office 365, but can work on-premises if you configure your farm accordingly . Navigation to {site url}/_layouts/appregnew.aspx Click \"Generate\" for both the Client Id and Secret values Give you add-in a title, this can be anything but will let you locate it in the list of add-in permissions Provide a fake value for app domain and redirect uri, you can use the values shown in the examples Click \"Create\" Copy the returned block of text containing the client id and secret as well as app name for your records and later in this article. Grant Your Add-In Permissions \u00b6 Now that we have created an add-in registration we need to tell SharePoint what permissions it can use. Due to an update in SharePoint Online you now have to register add-ins with certain permissions in the admin site .

This can be useful for debugging, testing, or injecting some custom functionality. Extensions work with any invokable . You can control just about any behavior of the library with extensions. Extensions do not work in ie11 compatability mode. This is by design. Types of Extensions \u00b6 There are three types of Extensions available as well as three methods for registration. You can register any type of extension with any of the registration options. Function Extensions \u00b6 The first type is a simple function with a signature: ( op : string , target : T , ... rest : any []) : void This function is passed the current operation as the first argument, currently one of \"apply\", \"get\", \"has\", or \"set\". The second argument is the target instance upon which the operation is being invoked. The remaining parameters vary by the operation being performed, but will match their respective ProxyHandler method signatures. Named Extensions \u00b6 Named extensions are designed to add or replace a single property or method, though you can register multiple using the same object. These extensions are defined by using an object which has the property/methods you want to override described. Registering named extensions globally will override that operation to all invokables. import { extendGlobal } from \"@pnp/odata\" ; import { sp , Lists , IWeb , ILists } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\" ; import { escapeQueryStrValue } from \"@pnp/sp/src/utils/escapeSingleQuote\" ; const myExtensions = { // override the lists property globally get lists ( this : IWeb ) : ILists { // we will always order our lists by title and select just the Title for ALL calls (just as an example) return Lists ( this ). orderBy ( \"Title\" ). select ( \"Title\" ); }, // override the getByTitle method globally (NOTE: this will also override and break any other method named getByTitle such as views.getByTitle) // this is done here as an example. It is better to do this type of extension on a per-object or factory basis. getByTitle : function ( this : ILists , title : string ) { // in our example our list has moved, so we rewrite the request on the fly if ( title === \"List1\" ) { return List ( this , `getByTitle('List2')` ); } else { // you can't at this point call the \"base\" method as you will end up in loop within the proxy // so you need to ensure you patch/include any original functionality you need return List ( this , `getByTitle(' ${ escapeQueryStrValue ( title ) } ')` ); } }, }; // register all the named Extensions extendGlobal ( myExtensions ); // this will use our extension to ensure the lists are ordered const lists = await sp . web . lists (); console . log ( JSON . stringify ( lists , null , 2 )); // we will get the items from List1 but within the extension it is rewritten as List2 const items = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"List1\" ). items (); console . log ( JSON . stringify ( items . length , null , 2 )); ProxyHandler Extensions \u00b6 You can also register a partial ProxyHandler implementation as an extension. You can implement one or more of the ProxyHandler methods as needed. Here we implement the same override of getByTitle globally. This is the most complicated method of creating an extension and assumes an understanding of how ProxyHandlers work. import { extendGlobal } from \"@pnp/odata\" ; import { sp , Lists , IWeb , ILists } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\" ; import { escapeQueryStrValue } from \"@pnp/sp/src/utils/escapeSingleQuote\" ; const myExtensions = { get : ( target , p : string | number | symbol , _receiver : any ) => { switch ( p ) { case \"getByTitle\" : return ( title : string ) => { // in our example our list has moved, so we rewrite the request on the fly if ( title === \"LookupList\" ) { return List ( target , `getByTitle('OrderByList')` ); } else { // you can't at this point call the \"base\" method as you will end up in loop within the proxy // so you need to ensure you patch/include any original functionality you need return List ( target , `getByTitle(' ${ escapeQueryStrValue ( title ) } ')` ); } }; } }, }; extendGlobal ( myExtensions ); const lists = sp . web . lists ; const items = await lists . getByTitle ( \"LookupList\" ). items (); console . log ( JSON . stringify ( items . length , null , 2 )); Registering Extensions \u00b6 You can register Extensions either globally, on an invokable factory, or on a per-object basis, and you can register a single extension or an array of Extensions. Global Registration \u00b6 Globally registering an extension allows you to inject functionality into every invokable that is instantiated within your application. It is important to remember that processing extensions happens on ALL property access and method invocation operations - so global extensions should be used sparingly. import { extendGlobal } from \"@pnp/odata\" ; // we can add a logging method to very verbosly track what things are called in our application extendGlobal (( op : string , _target : any , ... rest : any []) : void => { switch ( op ) { case \"apply\" : Logger . write ( ` ${ op } ::> ()` , LogLevel . Info ); break ; case \"has\" : case \"get\" : case \"set\" : Logger . write ( ` ${ op } ::> ${ rest [ 0 ] } ` , LogLevel . Info ); break ; default : Logger . write ( `unkown ${ op } ` , LogLevel . Info ); } }); Factory Registration \u00b6 The pattern you will likely find most useful is the ability to extend an invokable factory. This will apply your extensions to all instances created with that factory, meaning all IWeb's or ILists's will have the extension methods. The example below shows how to add a property to IWeb as well as a method to IList. import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/lists/web\" ; import { IWeb , Web } from \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import { ILists , Lists } from \"@pnp/sp/src/lists\" ; import { extendFactory } from \"@pnp/odata\" ; import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // declaring the module here sets up the types correctly when importing across your application declare module \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" { // we need to extend the interface interface IWeb { orderedLists : ILists ; } } // declaring the module here sets up the types correctly when importing across your application declare module \"@pnp/sp/src/lists\" { // we need to extend the interface interface ILists { getOrderedListsQuery : ( this : ILists ) => ILists ; } } extendFactory ( Web , { // add an ordered lists property get orderedLists ( this : IWeb ) : ILists { return this . lists . getOrderedListsQuery (); }, }); extendFactory ( Lists , { // add an ordered lists property getOrderedListsQuery ( this : ILists ) : ILists { return this . top ( 10 ). orderBy ( \"Title\" ). select ( \"Title\" ); }, }); // regardless of how we access the web and lists collections our extensions remain with all new instance based on const web = Web ( \"https://318studios.sharepoint.com/sites/dev/\" ); const lists1 = await web . orderedLists (); console . log ( JSON . stringify ( lists1 , null , 2 )); const lists2 = await Web ( \"https://318studios.sharepoint.com/sites/dev/\" ). orderedLists (); console . log ( JSON . stringify ( lists2 , null , 2 )); const lists3 = await sp . web . orderedLists (); console . log ( JSON . stringify ( lists3 , null , 2 )); Instance Registration \u00b6 You can also register Extensions on a single object instance, which is often the preferred approach as it will have less of a performance impact across your whole application. This is useful for debugging, overriding methods/properties, or controlling the behavior of specific object instances. Extensions are not transferred to child objects in a fluent chain, be sure you are extending the instance you think you are. Here we show the same override operation of getByTitle on the lists collection, but safely only overriding the single instance. import { extendObj } from \"@pnp/odata\" ; import { sp , List , ILists } from \"@pnp/sp/presets/all\" ; const myExtensions = { getByTitle : function ( this : ILists , title : string ) { // in our example our list has moved, so we rewrite the request on the fly if ( title === \"List1\" ) { return List ( this , \"getByTitle('List2')\" ); } else { // you can't at this point call the \"base\" method as you will end up in loop within the proxy // so you need to ensure you patch/include any original functionality you need return List ( this , `getByTitle(' ${ escapeQueryStrValue ( title ) } ')` ); } }, }; const lists = extendObj ( sp . web . lists , myExtensions ); const items = await lists . getByTitle ( \"LookupList\" ). items (); console . log ( JSON . stringify ( items . length , null , 2 )); Enable and Disable Extensions \u00b6 Extensions are automatically enabled when you set an extension through any of the above outlined methods. You can disable and enable extensions on demand if needed. import { enableExtensions , disableExtensions } from \"@pnp/odata\" ; // disable Extensions disableExtensions (); // enable Extensions enableExtensions (); Order of Operations \u00b6 It is important to understand the order in which extensions are executed and when a value is returned. Instance extensions* are always called first, followed by global Extensions - in both cases they are called in the order they were registered. This allows you to perhaps have some global functionality while maintaining the ability to override it again at the instance level. IF an extension returns a value other than undefined that value is returned and no other extensions are processed. *extensions applied via an extended factory are considered instance extensions","title":"Extending an OData library"},{"location":"odata/extensions/#extensions","text":"introduced in 2.0.0 Extending is the concept of overriding or adding functionality into an object or environment without altering the underlying class instances.

Create using IWeb.addClientSidePage \u00b6 import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/clientside-pages/web\" ; const page = await sp . web . addClientsidePage ( \"mypage1\" ); // ... other operations on the page as outlined below // the page is initially not published, you must publish it so it appears for others users await page . save (); // include title and page layout const page2 = await sp . web . addClientsidePage ( \"mypage\" , \"My Page Title\" , \"Article\" ); // you must publish the new page await page2 . save (); Create using CreateClientsidePage method \u00b6 import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import { Web } \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import { CreateClientsidePage } from \"@pnp/sp/src/clientside-pages\" ; const page1 = await CreateClientsidePage ( sp . web , \"mypage2\" , \"My Page Title\" ); // you must publish the new page await page1 . save ( true ); // specify the page layout type parameter const page2 = await CreateClientsidePage ( sp . web , \"mypage3\" , \"My Page Title\" , \"Article\" ); // you must publish the new page await page2 . save (); // use the web factory to create a page in a specific web const page3 = await CreateClientsidePage ( Web ( \"https://{absolute web url}\" ), \"mypage4\" , \"My Page Title\" ); // you must publish the new page await page3 . save (); Load Pages \u00b6 There a a few ways to load pages, each of which results in an IClientSidePage instance being returned. Load using IWeb.loadClientSidePage \u00b6 This method takes a server relative path to the page to load. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import { Web } \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/clientside-pages/web\" ; // use from the sp.web fluent chain const page = await sp . web . loadClientsidePage ( \"/sites/dev/sitepages/mypage3.aspx\" ); // use the web factory to target a specific web const page2 = await Web ( \"https://{absolute web url}\" ). loadClientsidePage ( \"/sites/dev/sitepages/mypage3.aspx\" ); Load using ClientsidePageFromFile \u00b6 This method takes an IFile instance and loads an IClientsidePage instance. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import { ClientsidePageFromFile } from \"@pnp/sp/src/clientside-pages\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files/web\" ; const page = await ClientsidePageFromFile ( sp . web . getFileByServerRelativePath ( \"/sites/dev/sitepages/mypage3.aspx\" )); Edit Sections and Columns \u00b6 Clientside pages are made up of sections, columns, and controls. Sections contain columns which contain controls. There are methods to operate on these within the page, in addition to the standard array methods available in JavaScript. These samples use a variable page that is understood to be an IClientsidePage instance which is either created or loaded as outlined in previous sections. // our page instance const page : IClientsidePage ; // add two columns with factor 6 - this is a two column layout as the total factor in a section should add up to 12 const section1 = page . addSection (); section1 . addColumn ( 6 ); section1 . addColumn ( 6 ); // create a three column layout in a new section const section2 = page . addSection (); section2 . addColumn ( 4 ); section2 . addColumn ( 4 ); section2 . addColumn ( 4 ); // publish our changes await page . save (); Manipulate Sections and Columns \u00b6 // our page instance const page : IClientsidePage ; // drop all the columns in this section // this will also DELETE all controls contained in the columns page . sections [ 1 ]. columns . length = 0 ; // create a new column layout page . sections [ 1 ]. addColumn ( 4 ); page . sections [ 1 ]. addColumn ( 8 ); // publish our changes await page . save (); Reorder Sections \u00b6 // our page instance const page : IClientsidePage ; // swap the order of two sections // this will preserve the controls within the columns page . sections = [ page . sections [ 1 ], page . sections [ 0 ]]; // publish our changes await page . save (); Reorder Columns \u00b6 The sections and columns are arrays, so normal array operations work as expected // our page instance const page : IClientsidePage ; // swap the order of two columns // this will preserve the controls within the columns page . sections [ 1 ]. columns = [ page . sections [ 1 ]. columns [ 1 ], page . sections [ 1 ]. columns [ 0 ]]; // publish our changes await page . save (); Clientside Controls \u00b6 Once you have your sections and columns defined you will want to add/edit controls within those columns.

We have added some methods to the library to help and their use is outlined below. Reading Files \u00b6 Reading files from the client using REST is covered in the below examples. The important thing to remember is choosing which format you want the file in so you can appropriately process it. You can retrieve a file as Blob, Buffer, JSON, or Text. If you have a special requirement you could also write your own parser . import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/folders\" ; sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/documents/file.avi\" ). getBlob (). then (( blob : Blob ) => {}); sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/documents/file.avi\" ). getBuffer (). then (( buffer : ArrayBuffer ) => {}); sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/documents/file.json\" ). getJSON (). then (( json : any ) => {}); sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/documents/file.txt\" ). getText (). then (( text : string ) => {}); // all of these also work from a file object no matter how you access it sp . web . getFolderByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/documents\" ). files . getByName ( \"file.txt\" ). getText (). then (( text : string ) => {}); Adding Files \u00b6 Likewise you can add files using one of two methods, add or addChunked. The second is appropriate for larger files, generally larger than 10 MB but this may differ based on your bandwidth/latency so you can adjust the code to use the chunked method. The below example shows getting the file object from an input and uploading it to SharePoint, choosing the upload method based on file size. declare var require : ( s : string ) => any ; import { ConsoleListener , Logger , LogLevel } from \"@pnp/logging\" ; import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import { Web } from \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/folders\" ; import { auth } from \"./auth\" ; let $ = require ( \"jquery\" ); //<-- used here for illustration let siteUrl = \"https://mytenant.sharepoint.com/sites/dev\" ; // comment this out for non-node execution // auth(siteUrl); Logger . subscribe ( new ConsoleListener ()); Logger . activeLogLevel = LogLevel . Verbose ; let web = Web ( siteUrl ); $ (() => { $ ( \"#testingdiv\" ). append ( \"<button id='thebuttontodoit'>Do It</button>\" ); $ ( \"#thebuttontodoit\" ). on ( 'click' , ( e ) => { e . preventDefault (); let input = < HTMLInputElement > document . getElementById ( \"thefileinput\" ); let file = input . files [ 0 ]; // you can adjust this number to control what size files are uploaded in chunks if ( file . size <= 10485760 ) { // small upload web . getFolderByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/Shared%20Documents/test/\" ). files . add ( file . name , file , true ). then ( _ => Logger . write ( \"done\" )); } else { // large upload web . getFolderByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/Shared%20Documents/test/\" ). files . addChunked ( file . name , file , data => { Logger . log ({ data : data , level : LogLevel.Verbose , message : \"progress\" }); }, true ). then ( _ => Logger . write ( \"done!\" )); } }); }); Setting Associated Item Values \u00b6 You can also update the file properties of a newly uploaded file using code similar to the below snippet: import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/folders\" ; sp . web . getFolderByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/Shared%20Documents/test/\" ). files . add ( file . name , file , true ). then ( f => { f . file . getItem (). then ( item => { item . update ({ Title : \"A Title\" , OtherField : \"My Other Value\" }); }); }); Update File Content \u00b6 You can of course use similar methods to update existing files as shown below: import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/folders\" ; sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/documents/test.txt\" ). setContent ( \"New string content for the file.\" ); sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/documents/test.mp4\" ). setContentChunked ( file ); Check in, Check out, and Approve & Deny \u00b6 The library provides helper methods for checking in, checking out, and approving files. Examples of these methods are shown below. Check In \u00b6 Check in takes two optional arguments, comment and check in type. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import { CheckinType } from \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; // default options with empty comment and CheckinType.Major sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). checkin (). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File checked in!\" ); }); // supply a comment (< 1024 chars) and using default check in type CheckinType.Major sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). checkin ( \"A comment\" ). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File checked in!\" ); }); // Supply both comment and check in type sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). checkin ( \"A comment\" , CheckinType . Overwrite ). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File checked in!\" ); }); Check Out \u00b6 Check out takes no arguments. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). checkout (). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File checked out!\" ); }); Approve and Deny \u00b6 You can also approve or deny files in libraries that use approval. Approve takes a single required argument of comment, the comment is optional for deny. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). approve ( \"Approval Comment\" ). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File approved!\" ); }); // deny with no comment sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). deny (). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File denied!\" ); }); // deny with a supplied comment. sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). deny ( \"Deny comment\" ). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File denied!\" ); }); Publish and Unpublish \u00b6 You can both publish and unpublish a file using the library. Both methods take an optional comment argument. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/webs\" ; import \"@pnp/sp/src/files\" ; // publish with no comment sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). publish (). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File published!\" ); }); // publish with a supplied comment. sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). publish ( \"Publish comment\" ). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File published!\" ); }); // unpublish with no comment sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). unpublish (). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File unpublished!\" ); }); // unpublish with a supplied comment. sp . web . getFileByServerRelativeUrl ( \"/sites/dev/shared documents/file.txt\" ). unpublish ( \"Unpublish comment\" ). then ( _ => { console . log ( \"File unpublished!\" ); }); Advanced Upload Options \u00b6 Both the addChunked and setContentChunked methods support options beyond just supplying the file content. progress function \u00b6 A method that is called each time a chunk is uploaded and provides enough information to report progress or update a progress bar easily. The method has the signature: (data: ChunkedFileUploadProgressData) => void The data interface is: export interface ChunkedFileUploadProgressData { stage : \"starting\" | \"continue\" | \"finishing\" ; blockNumber : number ; totalBlocks : number ; chunkSize : number ; currentPointer : number ; fileSize : number ; } chunkSize \u00b6 This property controls the size of the individual chunks and is defaulted to 10485760 bytes (10 MB). You can adjust this based on your bandwidth needs - especially if writing code for mobile uploads or you are seeing frequent timeouts. getItem \u00b6 This method allows you to get the item associated with this file. You can optionally specify one or more select fields.

This is made easy through the library and the following examples demonstrate these actions. Basic Get \u00b6 import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // get all the items from a list sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"My List\" ). items . get (). then (( items : any []) => { console . log ( items ); }); // get a specific item by id sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"My List\" ). items . getById ( 1 ). get (). then (( item : any ) => { console . log ( item ); }); // use odata operators for more efficient queries sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"My List\" ). items . select ( \"Title\" , \"Description\" ). top ( 5 ). orderBy ( \"Modified\" , true ). get (). then (( items : any []) => { console . log ( items ); }); Get Paged Items \u00b6 Working with paging can be a challenge as it is based on skip tokens and item ids, something that is hard to guess at runtime. To simplify things you can use the getPaged method on the Items class to assist. Note that there isn't a way to move backwards in the collection, this is by design. The pattern you should use to support backwards navigation in the results is to cache the results into a local array and use the standard array operators to get previous pages. Alternatively you can append the results to the UI, but this can have performance impact for large result sets. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // basic case to get paged items form a list let items = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . getPaged (); // you can also provide a type for the returned values instead of any let items = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . getPaged < { Title : string }[] > (); // the query also works with select to choose certain fields and top to set the page size let items = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . select ( \"Title\" , \"Description\" ). top ( 50 ). getPaged < { Title : string }[] > (); // the results object will have two properties and one method: // the results property will be an array of the items returned if ( items . results . length > 0 ) { console . log ( \"We got results!\" ); for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . results . length ; i ++ ) { // type checking works here if we specify the return type console . log ( items . results [ i ]. Title ); } } // the hasNext property is used with the getNext method to handle paging // hasNext will be true so long as there are additional results if ( items . hasNext ) { // this will carry over the type specified in the original query for the results array items = await items . getNext (); console . log ( items . results . length ); } getListItemChangesSinceToken \u00b6 The GetListItemChangesSinceToken method allows clients to track changes on a list. Changes, including deleted items, are returned along with a token that represents the moment in time when those changes were requested. By including this token when you call GetListItemChangesSinceToken, the server looks for only those changes that have occurred since the token was generated. Sending a GetListItemChangesSinceToken request without including a token returns the list schema, the full list contents and a token. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // Using RowLimit. Enables paging let changes = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). getListItemChangesSinceToken ({ RowLimit : '5' }); // Use QueryOptions to make a XML-style query. // Because it's XML we need to escape special characters // Instead of & we use &amp; in the query let changes = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). getListItemChangesSinceToken ({ QueryOptions : '<Paging ListItemCollectionPositionNext=\"Paged=TRUE&amp;p_ID=5\" />' }); // Get everything. Using null with ChangeToken gets everything let changes = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). getListItemChangesSinceToken ({ ChangeToken : null }); Get All Items \u00b6 Using the items collection's getAll method you can get all of the items in a list regardless of the size of the list. Sample usage is shown below. Only the odata operations top, select, and filter are supported. usingCaching and inBatch are ignored - you will need to handle caching the results on your own. This method will write a warning to the Logger and should not frequently be used. Instead the standard paging operations should be used. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // basic usage sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . getAll (). then (( allItems : any []) => { // how many did we get console . log ( allItems . length ); }); // set page size sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . getAll ( 4000 ). then (( allItems : any []) => { // how many did we get console . log ( allItems . length ); }); // use select and top. top will set page size and override the any value passed to getAll sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . select ( \"Title\" ). top ( 4000 ). getAll (). then (( allItems : any []) => { // how many did we get console . log ( allItems . length ); }); // we can also use filter as a supported odata operation, but this will likely fail on large lists sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . select ( \"Title\" ). filter ( \"Title eq 'Test'\" ). getAll (). then (( allItems : any []) => { // how many did we get console . log ( allItems . length ); }); Retrieving Lookup Fields \u00b6 When working with lookup fields you need to use the expand operator along with select to get the related fields from the lookup column. This works for both the items collection and item instances. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"LookupList\" ). items . select ( \"Title\" , \"Lookup/Title\" , \"Lookup/ID\" ). expand ( \"Lookup\" ). get (). then (( items : any []) => { console . log ( items ); }); sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"LookupList\" ). items . getById ( 1 ). select ( \"Title\" , \"Lookup/Title\" , \"Lookup/ID\" ). expand ( \"Lookup\" ). get (). then (( item : any ) => { console . log ( item ); }); Retrieving PublishingPageImage \u00b6 The PublishingPageImage and some other publishing-related fields aren't stored in normal fields, rather in the MetaInfo field. To get these values you need to use the technique shown below, and originally outlined in this thread . Note that a lot of information can be stored in this field so will pull back potentially a significant amount of data, so limit the rows as possible to aid performance. import { Web } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; const w = new Web ( \"https://{publishing site url}\" ); w . lists . getByTitle ( \"Pages\" ). items . select ( \"Title\" , \"FileRef\" , \"FieldValuesAsText/MetaInfo\" ) . expand ( \"FieldValuesAsText\" ) . get (). then ( r => { // look through the returned items. for ( var i = 0 ; i < r . length ; i ++ ) { // the title field value console . log ( r [ i ]. Title ); // find the value in the MetaInfo string using regex const matches = /PublishingPageImage:SW\\|(.*?)\\r\\n/ig . exec ( r [ i ]. FieldValuesAsText . MetaInfo ); if ( matches !== null && matches . length > 1 ) { // this wil be the value of the PublishingPageImage field console . log ( matches [ 1 ]); } } }). catch ( e => { console . error ( e ); }); Add Items \u00b6 There are several ways to add items to a list. The simplest just uses the add method of the items collection passing in the properties as a plain object. import { sp , ItemAddResult } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // add an item to the list sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"My List\" ). items . add ({ Title : \"Title\" , Description : \"Description\" }). then (( iar : ItemAddResult ) => { console . log ( iar ); }); Content Type \u00b6 You can also set the content type id when you create an item as shown in the example below: import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; sp . web . lists . getById ( \"4D5A36EA-6E84-4160-8458-65C436DB765C\" ). items . add ({ Title : \"Test 1\" , ContentTypeId : \"0x01030058FD86C279252341AB303852303E4DAF\" }); User Fields \u00b6 There are two types of user fields, those that allow a single value and those that allow multiple. For both types, you first need to determine the Id field name, which you can do by doing a GET REST request on an existing item. Typically the value will be the user field internal name with \"Id\" appended. So in our example, we have two fields User1 and User2 so the Id fields are User1Id and User2Id. Next, you need to remember there are two types of user fields, those that take a single value and those that allow multiple - these are updated in different ways. For single value user fields you supply just the user's id. For multiple value fields, you need to supply an object with a \"results\" property and an array. Examples for both are shown below. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import { getGUID } from \"@pnp/common\" ; sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"PeopleFields\" ). items . add ({ Title : getGUID (), User1Id : 9 , // allows a single user User2Id : { results : [ 16 , 45 ] // allows multiple users } }). then ( i => { console . log ( i ); }); If you want to update or add user field values when using validateUpdateListItem you need to use the form shown below. You can specify multiple values in the array. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; const result = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"UserFieldList\" ). items . getById ( 1 ). validateUpdateListItem ([{ FieldName : \"UserField\" , FieldValue : JSON.stringify ([{ \"Key\" : \"i:0#.f|membership|person@tenant.com\" }]), }, { FieldName : \"Title\" , FieldValue : \"Test - Updated\" , }]); Lookup Fields \u00b6 What is said for User Fields is, in general, relevant to Lookup Fields: - Lookup Field types: - Single-valued lookup - Multiple-valued lookup - Id suffix should be appended to the end of lookup's EntityPropertyName in payloads - Numeric Ids for lookups' items should be passed as values import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; import { getGUID } from \"@pnp/common\" ; sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"LookupFields\" ). items . add ({ Title : getGUID (), LookupFieldId : 2 , // allows a single lookup value MuptiLookupFieldId : { results : [ 1 , 56 ] // allows multiple lookup value } }). then ( console . log ). catch ( console . log ); Add Multiple Items \u00b6 import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; let list = sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"rapidadd\" ); list . getListItemEntityTypeFullName (). then ( entityTypeFullName => { let batch = sp . web . createBatch (); list . items . inBatch ( batch ). add ({ Title : \"Batch 6\" }, entityTypeFullName ). then ( b => { console . log ( b ); }); list . items . inBatch ( batch ). add ({ Title : \"Batch 7\" }, entityTypeFullName ). then ( b => { console . log ( b ); }); batch . execute (). then ( d => console . log ( \"Done\" )); }); Update \u00b6 The update method is very similar to the add method in that it takes a plain object representing the fields to update. The property names are the internal names of the fields. If you aren't sure you can always do a get request for an item in the list and see the field names that come back - you would use these same names to update the item. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; let list = sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"MyList\" ); list . items . getById ( 1 ). update ({ Title : \"My New Title\" , Description : \"Here is a new description\" }). then ( i => { console . log ( i ); }); Getting and updating a collection using filter \u00b6 import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // you are getting back a collection here sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"MyList\" ). items . top ( 1 ). filter ( \"Title eq 'A Title'\" ). get (). then (( items : any []) => { // see if we got something if ( items . length > 0 ) { sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"MyList\" ). items . getById ( items [ 0 ]. Id ). update ({ Title : \"Updated Title\" , }). then ( result => { // here you will have updated the item console . log ( JSON . stringify ( result )); }); } }); Update Multiple Items \u00b6 This approach avoids multiple calls for the same list's entity type name. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; let list = sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"rapidupdate\" ); list . getListItemEntityTypeFullName (). then ( entityTypeFullName => { let batch = sp . web . createBatch (); // note requirement of \"*\" eTag param - or use a specific eTag value as needed list . items . getById ( 1 ). inBatch ( batch ). update ({ Title : \"Batch 6\" }, \"*\" , entityTypeFullName ). then ( b => { console . log ( b ); }); list . items . getById ( 2 ). inBatch ( batch ). update ({ Title : \"Batch 7\" }, \"*\" , entityTypeFullName ). then ( b => { console . log ( b ); }); batch . execute (). then ( d => console . log ( \"Done\" )); }); Delete \u00b6 Delete is as simple as calling the .delete method. It optionally takes an eTag if you need to manage concurrency. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; let list = sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"MyList\" ); list . items . getById ( 1 ). delete (). then ( _ => {}); Resolving field names \u00b6 It's a very common mistake trying wrong field names in the requests. Field's EntityPropertyName value should be used. The easiest way to get know EntityPropertyName is to use the following snippet: import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( '[Lists_Title]' ) . fields . select ( 'Title, EntityPropertyName' ) . filter ( `Hidden eq false and Title eq '[Field's_Display_Name]'` ) . get () . then ( response => { console . log ( response . map ( field => { return { Title : field.Title , EntityPropertyName : field.EntityPropertyName }; })); }) . catch ( console . log ); Lookup fields' names should be ended with additional Id suffix. E.g. for Editor EntityPropertyName EditorId should be used.","title":"List Items"},{"location":"sp/items/#pnpspitems","text":"","title":"@pnp/sp/items"},{"location":"sp/items/#get","text":"Getting items from a list is one of the basic actions that most applications require.

Alternatively you can append the results to the UI, but this can have performance impact for large result sets. import { sp } from \"@pnp/sp\" ; // basic case to get paged items form a list let items = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . getPaged (); // you can also provide a type for the returned values instead of any let items = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . getPaged < { Title : string }[] > (); // the query also works with select to choose certain fields and top to set the page size let items = await sp . web . lists . getByTitle ( \"BigList\" ). items . select ( \"Title\" , \"Description\" ). top ( 50 ). getPaged < { Title : string }[] > (); // the results object will have two properties and one method: // the results property will be an array of the items returned if ( items . results . length > 0 ) { console . log ( \"We got results!\" ); for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . results . length ; i ++ ) { // type checking works here if we specify the return type console . log ( items . results [ i ].
